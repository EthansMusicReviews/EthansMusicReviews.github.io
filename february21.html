		  <p class="fontsize container">
			  I have to be honest, I may lose some credit and respect when I reveal this secret: I had not listened to a single Kendrick Lamar album from start to finish before I reviewed this album. Luckily, I did and I can’t say that I’m surprised by how blown away I am. Kendrick is widely regarded as one of the best rappers of all time. His flows are insane and I think the way he delivers his lyrics is so unique that it is obvious when you hear his voice.

				  This album had a few songs that I already heard, but there were more 
				  that I ended up liking a lot.  The chorus effect on “BLOOD.” is insane 
				  and I like the way it ends with one gunshot. Instead of bringing up the 
				  songs that are classics like “DNA.”, “HUMBLE.”, “PRIDE.” and “LOYALTY.” 
				  I want to focus on the songs that surprised me. I need to mention 
				  “LOVE.” which has been in my top 5 songs of the year since I first 
				  heard it in 2017 when the album was released. Even though I clearly 
				  love “LOVE.” the song “FEEL.” blew my mind. The melodic beat and the 
				  rapping style with barely any drums is my ideal song. I don’t remember 
				  the last time that I heard a song that felt as good as this one does. 
				  “FEAR.” shows off Kendrick’s great lyricism and rapping capabilities. 
				  “GOD.” has a really good beat which I think shows a different range for 
				  him, but is still Kendrick Lamar quality.

				  The one song I didn’t like on this album is “XXX.” I will be honest the 
				  chorus goes hard with the sirens and the aggressive rap style just 
				  works for Kendrick. I am hesitant to do this, especially because I 
				  haven’t listened to any of his other, higher ranked, albums and that 
				  could break my rating scale, but I can’t see myself giving this album 
				  anything else but a 10/10.

		  <p class="fontsize container">
			  Sea shanties; the music of the greatest swashbucklers in the world. From my 
			  first time watching “Pirates of the Carribean” to the game on my dad’s ipad, 
			  I have always been fascinated with pirates. Then in 2013 Abstergo Studios 
			  blessed the world with Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag. You sail as Edward 
			  Kenway and switch from hand to hand combat to fighting with you  own ship, 
			  the Jackdaw. I have now played the game 3 times and after listening to this 
			  playlist I can say that I have been inspired to 100% the game. It is my 
			  favorite single videogame of all time and I cannot stress how much I 
			  encourage you to give it a play.

				  Sea shanties have a great power of being able to make you feel like 
				  you yourself are sailing on the seas. Even though this playlist is 
				  missing the sounds of waves slapping the side of your boat, sails 
				  being hoisted and lowered, and Edwards sailing commands, the playlist 
				  still is amazing. “Leave Her Johnny” is my favorite song of the entire 
				  game. “Randy Dandy Oh” and “Fish in the Sea” are the most iconic songs 
				  in the game and I could listen to the crew of my ship sing these songs 
				  for hours, and I have!

				  I think it’s difficult to identify my dislikes in the playlist of songs 
				  because Sea Shanties are in a ranking system all their own. I can’t 
				  throw a Sea Shanty into most of my playlists, but I can make a playlist 
				  of the best Sea Shanties. One day I hope to drive my friends on a road 
				  trip and sing to these sea shanties. I would say the only song I don’t 
				  like is “Trooper and the Maid” because the main vocals are a female so 
				  I can’t sing to it. Overall I like how Sea Shanties can put me into the 
				  time of pirates and would definitely recommend Assassins Creed Black 
				  Flag, and Sea Shanties.

		  <h3 style="color:#3A9DFA">Gravity - 3/10</h3><p>by Brent Faiyaz ft. Steve Lacy, Tyler the Creator, and DJ Dahi</p>
			  <p class="fontsize container">
				  When I saw the people on this song, Tyler the Creator, Brent Faiyaz, 
				  and Steve Lacy I got very excited. Tyler and Steve are both decorated 
				  artists who I have nothing but respect for, and Brent is still undecided 
				  in my book. I didn’t really know what to expect, and “Gravity” lived 
				  up to that uncertainty.

					  The background guitar is clearly Steve Lacy designed and I kind of 
					  like it. The Brent Faiyaz vocals honestly work well in the chorus 
					  of the song, but it can be a little off in some lines. The Tyler 
					  vocals work really well with the beat way more than the Brent vocals.

				  <p class="fontsize container">
					  I like certain parts of the song, but there is no intro to the song 
					  which I dislike. The chorus does carry the song, but I feel like 
					  there isn’t much variety in backing music which takes away from the 
					  song as a whole. The lack of intro really put my vibes down. I was 
					  honestly let down by this release. I know that it was overall 
					  Brent’s project and I don’t really vibe with his music too well, 
					  but I was hoping to have more Tyler. This song isn’t short of 
					  potential, but it did certainly fall below my expectations.

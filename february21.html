			  The Duo you never knew you needed released a 7 song collaborative album in 
			  2018. Kid Cudi hums throughout the album and Kanye brings his amazing 
			  production skills. They performed together in the video linked below in 
			  one of the best performances I’ve seen. Major FOMO. I really like the two

				  I like the diversity of the songs on this album, but throughout the 
				  beats are phenomenal. Kanye and Cudi both have great production skills. 
				  “4th Dimension” has so many beat changes and “Kids See Ghosts” has such 
				  a spooky xylophone beat with Cudi’s light vocals. “Fire” has one of my 
				  favorite guitar solos at the end of the song. “Cudi Montage” uses 
				  guitar as the intro which is later transformed into an angelic chorus 
				  which shows how versatile each song is.

				  There are sections of some songs that I don’t like, but not entire 
				  songs. “Feel The Love” has a section of gunshots and random lyrics 
				  around 1:05 which I am not a fan of. Otherwise, I think the album is 
				  pretty underrated by a lot of Rap fans and hope that you enjoy it!

			  Jaden is pretty hit or miss. “PCH” was a great song and in the follow up 
			  album there weren’t too many hits, until his third album produced “Rainbow 
			  Bop”. I tried to listen to the other songs on all of his other albums, but 
			  some of them are too poppy for my liking. This song reminds me a lot of 
			  “PCH” and I’ll explain why further in my review.

				  I really like the instruments and beat changes in this song. The 
				  guitar is nice, but the variety of kicks and drums with the addition 
				  of flute make the beat interesting throughout the 4:40 long song. 
				  The bars that he spits are also not bad and quite memorable. I 
				  stumbled upon this through spotify’s recommendations and I really 
				  liked it. Overall it’s light and enjoyable to listen to.

				  My concern for this song is that it is going to be burnt out 
				  really fast. “PCH” was a great song, but after a month or two it 
				  got old and with that it was removed from my playlist. I think the 
				  lack of strong drums and light instrumentals like the flute will 
				  have the same effect on this song, but only time will tell.

				  This song once again came to my attention through TikTok and it 
				  didn’t disappoint. Three men were standing in a bathtub singing an 
				  a capella. Upon further research, I found out that the main vocalist 
				  in the band wrote this album about his dreams and this song is about 
				  his dreams concerning Anne Frank. He read “The Diary of Anne Frank” 
				  and was overcome by depression at the end of the book because of the 
				  intimacy he felt by getting a view into her mind and life. I think the 
				  hollow feeling is shown in this song, but it comes across in a nice way.

					  I really like the guitar in this song. It isn’t complicated, even 
					  I could play it, yet at the same time it is just enough to 
					  accompany the vocals. There is also a wonderful chorus that begins 
					  around 40 seconds that sounds almost like air flying past you in a 
					  plane. There are also brass instruments used in the middle of the 
					  song around 1:22. Overall the song is unique and a surprise in my 
					  opinion seeing as though I had never heard of the band before.

					  My only dislikes are that it doesn’t quite align with any of my

					  playlist to fit that YET, but I may have to make one. I also need 
					  to read into the lyrics more to fully understand the symbolism 
					  used which I will in the future. I enjoyed this surprise TikTok 
					  find for sure.

		  <p class="fontsize container">
			  I have to be honest, I may lose some credit and respect when I reveal this 
			  secret: I had not listened to a single Kendrick Lamar album from start to 
			  finish before I reviewed this album. Luckily, I did and I can’t say that 
			  I’m surprised by how blown away I am. Kendrick is widely regarded as one 
			  of the best rappers of all time. His flows are insane and I think the way 
			  he delivers his lyrics is so unique that it is obvious when you hear his 
			  voice.

				  This album had a few songs that I already heard, but there were more 
				  that I ended up liking a lot.  The chorus effect on “BLOOD.” is insane 
				  and I like the way it ends with one gunshot. Instead of bringing up the 
				  songs that are classics like “DNA.”, “HUMBLE.”, “PRIDE.” and “LOYALTY.” 
				  I want to focus on the songs that surprised me. I need to mention 
				  “LOVE.” which has been in my top 5 songs of the year since I first 
				  heard it in 2017 when the album was released. Even though I clearly 
				  love “LOVE.” the song “FEEL.” blew my mind. The melodic beat and the 
				  rapping style with barely any drums is my ideal song. I don’t remember 
				  the last time that I heard a song that felt as good as this one does. 
				  “FEAR.” shows off Kendrick’s great lyricism and rapping capabilities. 
				  “GOD.” has a really good beat which I think shows a different range for 
				  him, but is still Kendrick Lamar quality.

				  The one song I didn’t like on this album is “XXX.” I will be honest the 
				  chorus goes hard with the sirens and the aggressive rap style just 
				  works for Kendrick. I am hesitant to do this, especially because I 
				  haven’t listened to any of his other, higher ranked, albums and that 
				  could break my rating scale, but I can’t see myself giving this album 
				  anything else but a 10/10.

				  Sea shanties have a great power of being able to make you feel like 
				  you yourself are sailing on the seas. Even though this playlist is 
				  missing the sounds of waves slapping the side of your boat, sails 
				  being hoisted and lowered, and Edwards sailing commands, the playlist 
				  still is amazing. “Leave Her Johnny” is my favorite song of the entire 
				  game. “Randy Dandy Oh” and “Fish in the Sea” are the most iconic songs 
				  in the game and I could listen to the crew of my ship sing these songs 
				  for hours, and I have!

				  I think it’s difficult to identify my dislikes in the playlist of songs 
				  because Sea Shanties are in a ranking system all their own. I can’t 
				  throw a Sea Shanty into most of my playlists, but I can make a playlist 
				  of the best Sea Shanties. One day I hope to drive my friends on a road 
				  trip and sing to these sea shanties. I would say the only song I don’t 
				  like is “Trooper and the Maid” because the main vocals are too high of a
				  pitch for me to sing which takes away from the song because I feel that
				  you should be the main vocalist if you sing alone. Overall I like how 
				  Sea Shanties can put me into the time of pirates and would definitely 
				  recommend Assassins Creed Black Flag, and Sea Shanties.

					  The background guitar is clearly Steve Lacy designed and I kind of 
					  like it. The Brent Faiyaz vocals honestly work well in the chorus 
					  of the song, but it can be a little off in some lines. The Tyler 
					  vocals work really well with the beat way more than the Brent vocals.

					  I like certain parts of the song, but there is no intro to the song 
					  which I dislike. The chorus does carry the song, but I feel like 
					  there isn’t much variety in backing music which takes away from the 
					  song as a whole. The lack of intro really put my vibes down. I was 
					  honestly let down by this release. I know that it was overall 
					  Brent’s project and I don’t really vibe with his music too well, 
					  but I was hoping to have more Tyler. This song isn’t short of 
					  potential, but it did certainly fall below my expectations.

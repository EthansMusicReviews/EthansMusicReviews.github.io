			  In my opinion, Mac Miller is the greatest loss to the modern music industry

			  I think that shows through his music which often showcased his musical

				  I definitely have a soft spot for piano and physical instruments over 
				  electronic instruments which is why “Dunno” has more impact to me. Mac 
				  has a pretty good voice for a rapper and while it can be repetitive 
				  because his vocal range is limited, the piano serves him well in this 
				  song.

			  Well, I thought it would be a few weeks, but the next time that Will Paquin 
			  released music was almost half a year after his first release. I can 
			  imagine it must have been hard seeing as though he is still a student 
			  in college and had to record his vocals in his car which he revealed in 
			  a TikTok live the night of his new song’s release. It was a super cool 
			  experience to listen to him play random riffs and talk to fans, but I 
			  also felt like he was putting off imposter syndrome vibes. I also then 
			  watched the live release on youtube and was taken aback by the decent use 
			  of synths and you can watch the TikTok live below.

				  I like the fingerpicking pattern of this song although it sounds a lot 
				  like “Chandelier”. I think that the natural progression of the song is 
				  really good and Paquin leads with the guitar instead of drums which 
				  makes his music so special. I actually liked the synth that he used in 
				  this song and his section of anger at 50 seconds into the song is 
				  passionate and fits the meaning behind the song. I like the pauses that 
				  he puts in the song and the synth really adds to the song. I think that 
				  overall the words behind the song have more meaning. Overall I liked 
				  this song much more than “Chandelier” and I look forward to whatever 
				  songs he released in the (hopefully) near future. 
			  </p>
	  <center><h4 style="color:#3A9DFA">Dislikes:</h4></center>
			  <p class="fontsize container">
				  My list of dislikes for this song is pretty short. Firstly, I think he 
				  layered his voice for the first line or two of vocals which gives it a 
				  weird sound that to me sounds disconnected and hollow. This was fixed 
				  only a few lines into the song, but I could do without it. I know that 
				  it was his intention to keep the same core part of the song very 
				  similar to “Chandelier” but after months I feel like it is a new take 
				  on an old song. I have heard his other song ideas and they are more 
				  different to each other than “Now You Know” is to “Chandelier”. 
				  Otherwise I liked this song a lot more than his other and I think he’s 
				  on a good path for more music!

					  The intro to this song is  unique and also is mixed perfectly with 
					  the 808’s that lead in the song. With your bass turned up the harp 
					  intro combined with Critch’s powerful vocals and the song is insane. 
					  Usually the same backing beat isn’t my favorite but because the 
					  song is only two minutes I think it works perfectly.

					  My main complaint is the symbol synth sound that is used throughout

					  like a record skipping and I feel like he could have put another 
					  sample in there. The strength of the 808’s covers up the synth well 
					  but it definitely is a detractor from the song.

		  <p class="fontsize container">
			  Rex Orange County has been on my radar for artists for a good while since 
			  sleep away camp maybe 3 years ago when a girl told me she liked him. When 
			  I got home I listened to his songs like “Bestfriend” and “Loving Is Easy” 
			  but it wasn’t quite my taste until a year or so ago. One of the things that 
			  I admire the most about Rex is that in the beginning of the pandemic he 
			  would have Instagram Live concerts essentially for an hour or more at a 
			  time seamlessly switching from piano to guitar. He was just a person who 
			  wanted to spread some light in the chaos and I appreciated it a lot.

				  While this is only one song out of the album, I chose to focus on it 
				  because I think it can be overlooked. The guitar in the beginning 
				  serves as the perfect introduction to the song with Rex’s insecurities 
				  about his relationship. The next verse talks about how he has “boyish 
				  thoughts” and admits to his faults in an amazing climax of a brief 20 
				  second buildup of a chorus of echoey singing. Rex talks about wanting 
				  an encore of his life imagining marrying his girlfriend who he has since 
				  broken up with. The last minute of the song is a beautiful strings 
				  instrumental section that honestly takes my breath away. It ebbs and 
				  flows up and down and I can feel it in my chest.

				  I don’t like the lulls in this song. There are parts of the song that 
				  can drag a bit which I may feel because of how much I like the 
				  instrumental aspects of the song. My only other complaint is that at 
				  the end of the song, the strings end and there is a pitched down 
				  recording of Rex that interrupt the flow that was created right before 
				  it. I would have rather it simply end with the strings, and I almost 
				  never listen to the end anyway because I skip past it.

				  I was impressed that Ronan was able to come off so smooth given how 
				  shocked he was that Jay Critch actually accepted his request to go live. 
				  For around one minute they talked about school and it was just super

					  There are some absolute bangers like “Oh My Dis Side(feat. Quavo)”, 
					  “3500(feat.Future & 2 Chainz)”, “Impossible”, and “Maria I’m Drunk
					  (feat. Justin Beiber & Young Thug)”. While these songs are all in 
					  my playlists, nothing can top the <b>ART</b> that is “90210 (feat. 
					  Kacy Hill)”. This song is widely regarded as the best Travis song 
					  of all time, and for good reason. There is a massive beat switch 
					  halfway through the song, although I like the second first half 
					  better. The vocals from Hill and the production of the song are 
					  phenomenal together. The bars are crazy and I know without a doubt

					  I think that this album is a great demonstration of the capacity 
					  that Travis once had. He had amazing songs, but he also had songs 
					  that were not even close to his level. “Ok Alright” is lacking main 
					  drums or a good guitar chorus. The song is just lacking which is a 
					  common trend in other songs like “Never Catch Me”. Other songs have 
					  so much potential but I think Travis dropped the ball. “Never Catch 
					  Me” has a mean guitar in the intro and then the main song just 
					  completely falls off. It is an important stepping stone when looking 
					  at the path that Travis took to achieve the fame he has today, 
					  but it is clearly the worst when it comes to his entire discography.

				  I like the diversity of the songs on this album, but throughout the 
				  beats are phenomenal. Kanye and Cudi both have great production skills. 
				  “4th Dimension” has so many beat changes and “Kids See Ghosts” has such

				  favorite guitar solos at the end of the song. “Cudi Montage” uses

				  This song once again came to my attention through TikTok and it

					  I really like the guitar in this song. It isn’t complicated, even 
					  I could play it, yet at the same time it is just enough to 
					  accompany the vocals. There is also a wonderful chorus that begins 
					  around 40 seconds that sounds almost like air flying past you in a 
					  plane. There are also brass instruments used in the middle of the 
					  song around 1:22. Overall the song is unique and a surprise in my 
					  opinion seeing as though I had never heard of the band before.

					  My only dislikes are that it doesn’t quite align with any of my 
					  playlists. It has a granola kind of vibe and I don’t have a 
					  playlist to fit that YET, but I may have to make one. I also need 
					  to read into the lyrics more to fully understand the symbolism 
					  used which I will in the future. I enjoyed this surprise TikTok 
					  find for sure.

		  <p class="fontsize container">
			  I have to be honest, I may lose some credit and respect when I reveal this 
			  secret: I had not listened to a single Kendrick Lamar album from start to 
			  finish before I reviewed this album. Luckily, I did and I can’t say that 
			  I’m surprised by how blown away I am. Kendrick is widely regarded as one 
			  of the best rappers of all time. His flows are insane and I think the way 
			  he delivers his lyrics is so unique that it is obvious when you hear his 
			  voice.

				  This album had a few songs that I already heard, but there were more 
				  that I ended up liking a lot.  The chorus effect on “BLOOD.” is insane 
				  and I like the way it ends with one gunshot. Instead of bringing up the 
				  songs that are classics like “DNA.”, “HUMBLE.”, “PRIDE.” and “LOYALTY.” 
				  I want to focus on the songs that surprised me. I need to mention 
				  “LOVE.” which has been in my top 5 songs of the year since I first 
				  heard it in 2017 when the album was released. Even though I clearly 
				  love “LOVE.” the song “FEEL.” blew my mind. The melodic beat and the 
				  rapping style with barely any drums is my ideal song. I don’t remember 
				  the last time that I heard a song that felt as good as this one does. 
				  “FEAR.” shows off Kendrick’s great lyricism and rapping capabilities. 
				  “GOD.” has a really good beat which I think shows a different range for 
				  him, but is still Kendrick Lamar quality.

				  The one song I didn’t like on this album is “XXX.” I will be honest the 
				  chorus goes hard with the sirens and the aggressive rap style just 
				  works for Kendrick. I am hesitant to do this, especially because I 
				  haven’t listened to any of his other, higher ranked, albums and that 
				  could break my rating scale, but I can’t see myself giving this album 
				  anything else but a 10/10.

			  Sea shanties; the music of the greatest swashbucklers in the world. From my 
			  first time watching “Pirates of the Carribean” to the game on my dad’s ipad, 
			  I have always been fascinated with pirates. Then in 2013 Abstergo Studios 
			  blessed the world with Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag. You sail as Edward 
			  Kenway and switch from hand to hand combat to fighting with you  own ship, 
			  the Jackdaw. I have now played the game 3 times and after listening to this 
			  playlist I can say that I have been inspired to 100% the game. It is my 
			  favorite single videogame of all time and I cannot stress how much I 
			  encourage you to give it a play.

				  Sea shanties have a great power of being able to make you feel like 
				  you yourself are sailing on the seas. Even though this playlist is 
				  missing the sounds of waves slapping the side of your boat, sails 
				  being hoisted and lowered, and Edwards sailing commands, the playlist 
				  still is amazing. “Leave Her Johnny” is my favorite song of the entire 
				  game. “Randy Dandy Oh” and “Fish in the Sea” are the most iconic songs 
				  in the game and I could listen to the crew of my ship sing these songs 
				  for hours, and I have!

				  I think it’s difficult to identify my dislikes in the playlist of songs 
				  because Sea Shanties are in a ranking system all their own. I can’t 
				  throw a Sea Shanty into most of my playlists, but I can make a playlist 
				  of the best Sea Shanties. One day I hope to drive my friends on a road 
				  trip and sing to these sea shanties. I would say the only song I don’t 
				  like is “Trooper and the Maid” because the main vocals are too high of a
				  pitch for me to sing which takes away from the song because I feel that
				  you should be the main vocalist if you sing alone. Overall I like how 
				  Sea Shanties can put me into the time of pirates and would definitely 
				  recommend Assassins Creed Black Flag, and Sea Shanties.

				  When I saw the people on this song, Tyler the Creator, Brent Faiyaz, 
				  and Steve Lacy I got very excited. Tyler and Steve are both decorated 
				  artists who I have nothing but respect for, and Brent is still undecided

					  The background guitar is clearly Steve Lacy designed and I kind of 
					  like it. The Brent Faiyaz vocals honestly work well in the chorus 
					  of the song, but it can be a little off in some lines. The Tyler 
					  vocals work really well with the beat way more than the Brent vocals.

					  I like certain parts of the song, but there is no intro to the song 
					  which I dislike. The chorus does carry the song, but I feel like 
					  there isn’t much variety in backing music which takes away from the 
					  song as a whole. The lack of intro really put my vibes down. I was 
					  honestly let down by this release. I know that it was overall 
					  Brent’s project and I don’t really vibe with his music too well, 
					  but I was hoping to have more Tyler. This song isn’t short of 
					  potential, but it did certainly fall below my expectations.

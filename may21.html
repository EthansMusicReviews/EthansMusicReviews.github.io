							<p class="fontsize"> 
							The beat is super ominous and reminds me of “5% Tint” by 
							Travis Scott. The bars that Critch delivers are out of this

							works really well with the beat and the song definitely makes 
							me bop my head to the beat.
							</p> 
					
				<h4 style="color:gray">Dislikes:</h4> 
							<p class="fontsize"> 
							My main complaint about this song is that the 808’s hit twice 
							which sounds off when you listen on headphones, but sounds 
							good on car speakers. It gives the weird effect of sounding 
							like bass slap, but it does what it is intended to do.

							Originally leaked on Tik Tok, this song did not disappoint 
							when the full song was released. The synth and drums on the

							song a hit.

							I think that the airy synths and beat make this song

							beat is so entertaining. The vocals create a feeling in your 
							chest that makes you want to drive with the windows down on a

							I’m not sure if I have any dislikes, but I don’t think I can

							teenagers to listen to sad music, but happy music is something

							This live was pretty much on par with Rex’s old lives, but the 
							new song was phenomenal. It alone added points to this review 
							and created so much hype for his new album. In terms of the 
							song, I already have watched the screen recording maybe 20 
							times. It’s practically already in my playlists but I really 
							hope he doesn’t do too much on production and keeps it pretty 
							stripped.

							The flow on this song is out of this world. The beat and 
							intro are phenomenal.  I think that J Cole is hitting a new 
							level in his rap which is a shame because he was just signed 
							to a basketball team in Africa. Overall this song makes me 
							really excited for the album dropping in two days. The pauses 
							in the beat and the overall drums fit so well with the song. 
					</p> 
					
				<h4 style="color:gray">Dislikes:</h4> 
							<p class="fontsize"> 
							I think that the intro to this song is a little bit too long 
							seeing as though the vocals carry the song. I can’t criticize 
							his vocals because they are perfect and absolutely fire. 
							However, I am hesitant to give this song a 10 because I haven’t 
							heard the album yet and want to view it in the frame of the 
							entire album before I can rank it at the top of the list.

				Don Toliver is the product of talent and Travis Scott. Signed to Scott’s

				<h4 style="color:gray">Dislikes:</h4>

							My only complaint is that the song is a little repetitive

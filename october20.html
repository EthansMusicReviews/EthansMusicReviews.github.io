           		<h3>Chandelier - 7/10</h3><p>by Will Paquin</p> 
				<p class="fontsize"> 
				Will Paquin began his music career on TikTok when he posted a video sitting on a porch with a sunset 
				in the background. I remember scrolling on my for you page and feeling an unusual comfort when he 
				played his first draft of his first song "Chandelier". His use of harmonics is a refreshing sound in 
				the indie scene that drew me in immediately. Also, the background of his first video features a wood 
				and cable railing that I hope to have in my home in the future. Overall Paquin demonstrates the power
				of Tik Tok in the music industry as on October 20th he posted a picture showing 1,000,000 listens on 
				his FIRST song "Chandelier" in under one month. This kind of success for an artist who captioned one
				of his first videos "I don't sing so be nice" is unheard of. I am a huge fan and can't wait for Paquin 
				to release more music.

					<p style="font-size:14px">This is a cool slowed + reverb LoFi version of "Chandelier" and I like it even better than the original</p>
					<br />

					<h4>Likes:</h4>
								<p class="fontsize"> 
								In general I really enjoyed the results of Paquin's first song. I feel that sometimes when an artist plays
								a rift it can sometimes produce a sub-par song, yet "Chandelier" was a solid track. The lyrics established
								a good baseline for the future of his music which can be seen throughout his recent videos of conceptual
								songs. I find myself not getting enough of his music and constantly looking for more rifts or tunes to 
								listen to. 
								</p> 
								
					<h4>Dislikes:</h4> 
								<p class="fontsize"> The only dislike I have about "Chandelier" is the use of what I would describe
								as the sound a homing missile would make as it approaches its target. I wish he hadn't included it in the song 
								simply because the rest of it is something I could fall asleep to and the one synth song he put in clashes with
								the rest of the song. Luckily it only comes up a few times in the song which is why I rated the song a 7. 
								Without this sound I could have given it a 10.

           		<h3>Talkhouse Podcast - 6/10</h3><p>featuring Mac Demarco and Dayglow</p> 
				<p class="fontsize"> 
				The talkhouse podcast is a true treat for any indie lover. Instagram ads blessed me and advertised that Mac Demarco,
				one of my favorite artists, had a podcast with Dayglow, an artist that I knew <em>of</em> but not about. In the 
				podcast, the two artists discuss touring, the impact of COVID on the industry, and various other topics. Demarco becomes
				a big brother type of figure during the podcast by imparting tidbits of information with young Dayglow, yet they 
				also can share a laugh over their work.

					<h4 style="color:gray">Likes:</h4>
								<p class="fontsize"> 
								I am a huge fan of the matchup of talent in this podcast. To put a veteran artist like
					 			Mac in a call with Dayglow, an artist on the edge of establishing himself in the industry, it created the perfect 
								environment for the podcast. It was the perfect listen for a late weeknight and served its purpose as background music
								as I did some homework. As a huge fan of Mac, any new content was good content and it was interesting to hear about
								the effects of the pandemic on the indie music industry.  
								</p> 
								
					<h4 style="color:white">Dislikes:</h4> 
								<p class="fontsize"> 
								I found the 45 minute podcast to drag at times when the conversation slowed naturally. Mac has a very calm
								demeanor which translated in the podcast. I think that the situation in general is uncomfortable when you
								meet someone virtually, so that likely contributed to the awkwardness. Overall, the slow pace was the only
								thing that I disliked, but it weighed heavily on my ranking.

	<h3>Savage Mode 2 - 2/10</h3><p>by 21 Savage</p> 
	<p class="fontsize"> 
	Metro Boomin and 21 Savage released their much anticipated follow up to the iconic album "Savage Mode", and I was
	sadly underwhelmed. Their first album yielded songs that are still on my playlist nearly four and a half years 
	later like "X" and "Savage Mode". In their second album, I found the intro "Intro" featuring Morgan Freeman to 
	be the best part of the album.

					<p class="fontsize"> 
					The only thing I can say that I do like is the features that the album includes. Drake consistently puts out catchy and enjoyable 
					songs, but not on this song. Morgan Freeman is arguably one of the most shocking and beneficial additions to the album. His two songs,
					which are more like voice recordings, went viral on Tik Tok which helped to boost views.  
					</p> 
					
		<h4 style="color:gray">Dislikes:</h4> 
					<p class="fontsize"> 
					I'll keep this short by saying I disliked everything else on the album. I found the beats to be uncoordinated and clashing with other 
					instruments used in songs. I was hoping for big results with Drake as a feature but "Mr. Right Now" has a weird high pitched beat
					mixed with 808's and hi-hats. In my opinion without the main beat, it would have been a hit. Overall disappointed and skipped most 
					of the songs in the album and I don't plan on ever listening to one of its songs even after trying to re-listen to find a new appreciation
					to no avail. A big sequel album let down in the wake of high expectations.

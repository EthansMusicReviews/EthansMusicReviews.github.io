			  <p class="fontsize container">
				  When I heard that <em>the</em> Michael Cera was a released musician I almost ran around
				  my room. I had first seen him grow up on “Arrested Development” which I absolutely 
				  recommend. It can be found on Netflix, but this is a music review website not a TV show
			      review website. I knew that he played music from a viral meme of him being awkward in
				  public which is in part why I think people like him so much. I feel like he’s awkward
				  without embarrassment which is very difficult for many people. Below is the meme that 
				  I am referencing. I was shocked by what I heard when I listened to his 2014 album for the first time.

					  Never in a million years would I expect Michael Cera to create such a musical 
					  masterpiece. There is something about how the album hosts such a variety of 
					  sounds and instruments that makes it enjoyable. There are sad piano songs, like 
					  “Moving In” which has a bellowing piano that is muffled but belligerent with 
					  heavy keystrokes. Sidebar that was a crazy description bellowing and belligerent 
					  wow SAT words. The few songs with vocals are folky and the harmonies in combination 
					  with the soft guitar make me feel comfortable like I’m a dog in the sun. I could 
					  only identify Cera’s voice in “Clay Pigeons”, but it’s not terrible. His musical 
					  talent is apparent and I like the vocals he chose in his songs. “Steady Now” is 
					  one of his indie-esk songs which is honestly not bad. Would I add it to my playlist, 
					  no, but I could see others liking it.

					  “What Gives(...I Can’t Live Like This)” is just a series of uncoordinated crashing 
					  and squeaky uncoordinated instruments. Audibly It’s extremely unpleasurable, but it 
					  conveys a story. Cera is tired of living in chaos and noise that doesn’t work together. 
					  Lyrical Genius. I’ve listened to the album a few times and I’m left feeling comforted 
					  and a little confused. I don’t really know what to make of this album: it has no lyrics 
					  and lyrics, piano and guitar, folk and classical. I feel like it suits Cera’s awkward 
					  personality and it is pleasurable to listen to. I just need more time to see if I really 
					  do enjoy it which is why I rated it a check in with me in a few weeks/10.

			  <p class="fontsize container">
				  As previously mentioned in my review of Steve Lacy’s album <a href=“december20.html/#thelofi-s>“The 
				  LoFi-s”</a>, Steve Lacy mastered, produced, and recorded this song on GarageBand which blows my mind. 
				  He actually sings at the different pitches you can hear through tons of vocal recordings. I like Steve 
				  and his alt style, but sometimes his music is too experimental for me. In this case, it is just right 
				  on my scale.

					  This song is really special. When I first listened to it many years ago I remember being frustrated 
					  that I couldn’t find anything else that sounds like it which you would expect with music. But I 
					  still find myself getting upset that I can’t find more music that matches the  general sound of a 
					  song I like. Anyway, I like the lyrics in this song, in part because they are easy to remember, but 
					  also because the way Lacy sings them is perfectly drawn out and it makes me feel it in my chest when 
					  he sings, “Something baaaaad about to happen to me” perfectly on time with the beat changing from 
					  the drum intro to the full song. I like the drums and the chorus that he sings. Before each verse he 
					  stops the drums and guitar for just a second and then starts the verse. It really is very impressive 
					  that he managed to make this on GarageBand because of the drums and guitar. Mad respect.

				  I listened to this song for the first time when I was driving with my dad going to pick up pizza in town 
				  and I was shocked. Vampire Weekend has a cult following and I was not about  to get wrapped up in it. 
				  However this one song will forever mean something to me and I like their song “A-Punk” which I had 
				  listened to for many years snowboarding without realizing who the band even was.

					  The intro guitar of this song is insane. There are two guitarists who almost speak to each 
					  other with their rifts. I like how the guitar rift goes from higher to lower and the vocals 
					  remain balanced in the middle. The non-words from the band and the lyrics from the lead 
					  singer, Ezra Koenig, mesh in a beautiful symphony of sound. I really like this song and it 
					  has withstood the test of one year of listening to it which isn’t too bad. I think the song 
					  never gets boring and the constant change in drums and guitar and everything else going on 
					  makes it a really enjoyable listen.

					  The only development I have encountered is that sometimes it doesn’t quite match my mood. 
					  When I want to listen to indie it usually means a more melodic laid back vibe rather than 
					  the exciting rifts that are in the song. It still is a great song, but I have yet to make 
					  a playlist that it fits in, in the right way. Right now it’s my little ugly duckling that 
					  will be beautiful someday. I didn’t give it a higher rating because I’m just not too 
					  enthusiastic about it.

				  In my opinion this album gets way too much hate and there are countless great songs. Compared 
				  to other Travis projects, I think this was a little more rushed than other projects which 
				  were released at a much higher quality. Contrary to belief, I will go on record saying that 
				  I like “Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight” more than “Days Before Rodeo”. I think it is important 
				  to ignore public opinion and make your own opinion about the album.

					  There are countless BANGERS on this playlist: “Goosebumps”, “sdp Interlude”, “Pick up the 
					  Phone”, “Way Back”, and “Pick up the Phone”. Those 5 songs alone make the album significant 
					  for my music listening history. “Goosebumps” is one of the top 3 most known Travis Scott 
					  songs of all time. “The Ends” and “Way Back” are great songs to start the album with and they 
					  set a good tone for the rest of what you would expect the album to sound like. “Through the 
					  late Night” has a next level Kid Cudi feature that is hidden from the tracklist. Travis often 
					  doesn’t put features in the song title to make his listeners appreciate his music for it’s 
					  quality rather than it’s features which I respect to a high degree.

					  With all the good, there is also a lot of bad like “First Take”, which is not my style at 
					  all. Travis’s vocals are flat. The middle of “lose” is a weird section of the song which 
					  takes away from the potential of the song. “Guidance” isn’t a Travis song in my mind because 
					  it has an upbeat rhythm that doesn’t fit with the album. “Coordinate” isn’t bad, but I think 
					  it doesn't fit into my definition of what Travis’s music sounds like because it has such a weak 
					  beat when he has other songs with outrageous beats which are shown in literally every 
					  “Astroworld” song. Overall, I feel like the album could have some more unity which is the thing 
					  this project lacks when compared to Travis’s other albums.

			  <p class="fontsize container">
				  When I listened to “Man on the Moon III”, I listened to the first and second before to set 
				  the tone for the third. This album really is something special. There are songs on this 
				  album that literally <em>made</em> Kid Cudi’s career. This was Cudi’s first album and before 
				  I listened to it, in its entirety of 15 songs on the regular album, I had already listened to 
				  a variety of the songs on “Man on the Moon: The End of Day”.  Cudi is known for his lyrical 
				  genius along with his perfect balance of melodic beats. The album is about dreams which is clear 
				  in the title of the first song “In My Dreams(Cudder Anthem)”.  This being said, when a song has 
				  (nightmare) after it, it is about the nightmares in Cudi’s life and are much darker which is tied 
				  to Mr. Rager who is the darker side of Cudi in Man on the Moon 2. Even 12 years after this album 
				  was released, it still is just as good as the day it was released.

					  This album is in my opinion the best of the trilogy of the “Man on the Moon” releases. 
					  “In My Dreams(Cudder Anthem)” is deeply melodic and the end of the song features a 
					  PSA type announcement from Cudi himself. “Simple As…” is one of my favorite songs on 
					  the album. I love how he makes a beat out of the numbers 1,2, and 3 and the letters a,b,c. 
					  “Solo Dolo(Nightmare)” is eerie but the baseline roots the song down and it creates the 
					  perfect tension. “Day ‘N’ Night(nightmare)” is a notorious college party remix song and 
					  I listened to it many times in my underclassmen years of high school. “Alive(Nightmare)” 
					  and “Cudi Zone” are both top notch songs. “Make Her Say” features “Poker Face” by Lady 
					  Gaga while also hosting a Kanye West feature. “Pursuit of Happiness(Nightmare)” has a 
					  pretty sick guitar solo. “Up Up & Away” is a great way to end the album because it is 
					  very upbeat and completes a cycle from dark to light which is a constant battle in the
					  album and in Cudi’s life.

				  <p class="fontsize container">
					  “Heart of a Lion(Kid Cudi Theme)” isn’t my kind of song. It is still a good song, 
					  but I think he has other, better songs. “My World” is a little monotone even though 
					  I like the beat. I don’t think the album is perfect by any means, but I think it’s 
					  damn close. I like most of Cudi’s beats and when he strays too far I think it 
					  doesn’t fit with the flow of the album, but over time he has reeled that in by 
					  releasing more experimental music over time in subsequent albums. Kid Cudi is a rap 
					  god and I think many people recognize his genius and I hope you do too.

				  Kanye probably wrote this in the midst of a bipolar episode… At least I hope he did 
				  because it’s terrible. When this song was released, Kanye believed  that he would win 
				  the 2020 election, which he was not even close to doing and I feel like that chaos 
				  may have pushed him to release this. He has a leaked album called “DONDA” which is 
				  for his mother and everyone would have preferred for him to drop that rather than 
				  this garbage. I still think that you should never doubt Kanye, because he always 
				  turns it around and says “haha look at you, you never should have doubted me. I’m 
				  Kanye!” This clearly isn’t Kanye quality and I hope the next music he releases is 
				  much better. The video below is the music video of the remix of "Nah Nah Nah" which
				  is better, but not by much. I reviewed the original song just so you know.

					  The only thing I like in the entire song is the fact that Kanye samples Star Wars 
					  Revenge of the Sith when he sings, “Don’t jump Anakin I have the higher ground” 
					  followed by Obi-Wan Kanobi saying it in the movie. I don’t know why he sampled it 
					  and I didn’t think that he could ruin a cinematic masterpiece in such a prosperous 
					  movie franchise, but he did it.

					  I cannot find a single thing to say that could save this song. The beat is uncoordinated

					  understand why, you better start listening to my recommendations because it is absolutely 
					  terrible.

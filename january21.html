		  <p class="fontsize container">
			  This song is in my opinion one of the best singles Daniel Caesar has 
			  released. The piano and his voice are one and it is honestly beautiful. 
			  Overall I think he has one of the best voices in the pop/R&B genre. I 
			  often wind down to his music because of the use of the piano and harmonies 
			  and melodies. I 10/10 recommend him for sleep time.

				  I like the fact that he put in fake audience noise in the beginning 
				  of the song because it makes it feel like you are listening to the 
				  song with other people. You feel included in the song and the experience 
				  which is very special. The piano is amazing and ties in perfectly 
				  with the intricacies of Caesar’s voice. I like how he drags out 
				  certain words which doesn’t make this song boring like other songs f
				  rom different artists. He also has a tooth gap which provides another 
				  piece of evidence that musical artists with a front-tooth-gap are 
				  superior. My evidence to support this theory: Daniel Caesar and Mac 
				  Demarco. Continuing he even sings at a higher pitch and the song ends 
				  with only the piano and organ.

				  I didn’t go into this review thinking that I would award a 10/10, but

				  perfect balance. I would definitely recommend this song and wish you 
				  luck in life.

				  There are a few really great songs in this album. “KOD” has heavy 808’s 
				  and a good balance of hi-hats and lyrics round it out really well. 
				  “Photograph” has a really great variation of vocal speed which keeps it 
				  interesting. “ATM” has the most contagious beat on the album and is 
				  overall okay minus the neverending repetition of the main chorus. By 
				  far, “Kevin’s Heart” is the best song on this album. I think it has 
				  the perfect mix of drums and bass with synth in the background. “1985” 
				  is the most popular song and was my biggest surprise listening to the 
				  whole album for the first time. It has a great story and amazing lyrics 
				  which lead to his next album which will release this year called 
				  “The Fall Off”.

				  Although there are highlights to the album, I find most of the other 
				  songs to fall behind. “Motiv8” has some of the best rapping, but the 
				  beat isn’t there. Without a strong beat, J.Cole doesn’t have what he 
				  needs to put his music over the quality line that my playlists maintain. 
				  I hope that his next album is better because there are many missed 
				  opportunities on this one.

					  I like the slow pace of this song and the almost sad guitar. The 
					  slow nature and the reverb on the guitar really sets the tone of 
					  the song. The continuous base and chorus are really nice, and I

					  My main complaint with this song is how long it is. If a song is 5

					   better be “Runaway” level. I think the song lacks some diversity 
					   that would put it in the top tier but it is a solid song as a whole.

			  <p class="fontsize container">
				  It is with a heavy heart that I review this album by the great Mac Miller. 
				  He tragically died from a drug overdose in September of 2018. Yesterday, 
				  January 19th would have been his 29th birthday. This album was in its final 
				  stages of production when Mac passed which made it, in my opinion, the 
				  best posthumous album I’ve ever heard. It follows Mac’s 2018 album, 
				  “Swimming” in which he struggled with drugs but found himself swimming 
				  through the waves to calm waters. In a way “Circles” gives me a feeling 
				  that Mac is finally at peace. He no longer has to fight with rough water 
				  and can swim in circles. You should most definitely watch the video below to 
				  learn about the symbolism of the album. A really cool video like actually 
				  go watch it now.

					  I really like the start of this album which is led off with “Circles”. 
					  “Blue World” is a very upbeat song with a really good backing beat. It 
					  is the second most popular song on the album for a reason. “Good News” 
					  was the song that I listened to for the second most times in 2020. “I 
					  Can See” makes you feel like you're floating with its melodic music. 
					  “Woods” has a great beat as well. I feel like I keep saying the same 
					  thing, but besides one song, every single track has amazing vocals and 
					  unique beats. It surely would be different if Mac was alive, but it 
					  gives off the feeling that he knew what he wanted the album to consist 
					  of and it turned out to be amazing. 
				  </p>
		  <center><h4 style="color:#3A9DFA">Dislikes:</h4></center>
				  <p class="fontsize container">
					  To start, “That’s On Me” isn’t bad, but he repeats the same vocal for 
					  over a minute which does not float my boat. “Hands” has a beat that is 
					  a little too experimental for my liking on a rap/ neo-soul album. I do 
					  like the vocals on that song though. “Complicated” has a beat really 
					  similar to Khalid’s song “Talk” which is a little too poppy for me. 
					  Again the lyrics that Mac sings can make any beat stay in the green 
					  in my book. I think that when you view the album in the series of Mac 
					  Miller released projects, it shows his growth from his initial albums 
					  and despite his tragic death, it still manages to feel like he was alive 
					  to shape it exactly how he wanted it to be.

					  I like how this brought a new hype to a classic rap song. Simply put, 
					  this is the party version of regular “Goosebumps”. The drop is insane 
					  and I am confident that this will be the song I hear in college. I’ve 
					  listened to this song before working out and it gets me hyped up for sure.

					  I don’t have many dislikes, but my main criticism is that they removed 
					  the Kendrick verse. It added so much to the original and taking it out 
					  makes the song feel slightly repetitive. My other criticism is that it 
					  isn’t too crazy which has its pros and cons. On one hand, the song 
					  keeps its roots and still sounds pretty close to the original. On the 
					  other hand, the simple change in the beat gets boring after the first 
					  few listens. The beat still hits hard, but it isn’t the same after a 
					  week or two of listening to it. I gave it a 6 because I really appreciate 
					  the new twist on a song that I already love, but I think it isn’t nearly 
					  as good as the raw original and it removed such a key part of the song. 
					  Hopefully it is better when it is mixed with other songs.

				  I have a story for you once again. Summer of 2018 my family took a trip to Italy 
				  and “Scorpion” dropped the day/night I was arriving. Italy time was 6 hours ahead 
				  of the East Coast, so when I woke up at 6 in the morning in Venice I immediately 
				  checked Spotify for Drake’s new release. I didn’t find it at the time and went 
				  out to do tourist things for the morning. Then we came back at lunch for a little 
				  jet-lag nap and I listened to “Scorpion” in one of the most comfortable beds and 
				  nicest hotel rooms I’ve ever been in. Overall probably one of my favorite release

					  The songs that I like on this album, I really like. “Emotionless” is a classic 
					  for me. The piano intro into the 808 and kick beat is perfect. The sampling 
					  in the back is perfect in contrast to Drake’s articulate lyrics. “God’s Plan” 
					  blew up on a scale probably equal to “Sicko Mode” by Travis Scott. Initially 
					  I thought the iconic lyrics that come perfectly at the beat drop are, “I only 
					  love my bed and momma, I’m sorry” , but really Drake sings. “I only love Mahbed 
					  and my momma, I’m sorry”. Drake reveals that he has a son on this album which was 
					  monumental news. “I’m Upset” has a beat that puts a scowl on my face: it’s so good 
					  it’s dirty. “8 Out of 10” has an almost old fashioned beat. “Mob Ties” is also on 
					  my playlist, but it’s not too high up on my list of songs from this album. “Can’t 
					  Take a Joke” also features a fast 808 + Hi Hat beat and neutral rapping from Drake.
					  I think it has a great balance. “Sandra’s Rose” is my favorite song on Disc 1 of 
					  the album which is split in two parts. I love the beat of this song the most. “Is 
					  There More” is another honorable mention. I like the unnatural beat and the lyrics 
					  are consistent. “Peak”, “Blue Tint”, and “In My Feelings” were the two honorable 
					  mentions. Besides the songs that I mention below, everys other song on Disk 2 is 
					  just next level for me. I still have these songs more than Disk 1 songs on my 
					  playlist. Overall I liked the second half much more, but it still provided much 
					  needed Drake hits for the summer of ‘18 and the years since. 
				  </p>
		  <center><h4 style="color:#3A9DFA">Dislikes:</h4></center>
				  <p class="fontsize container">
					  There are a few songs that I disliked: “Survival” - too lyrical, “Elevate” - 
					  don’t like the chorus that Drake chose, “Talk Up” - too much going on in the 
					  background that make Drake’s lyrics seem overly aggressive, “Don’t Matter To 
					  Me” isn’t a bad song, but I can’t listen to anything with Michael Jackson in 
					  it without thinking about the terrible things he did with children, “Final 
					  Fantasy” - don’t like the beat. Lastly, “March 14” is a wonderfully written 
					  song that reveals Drake’s son to the world and the struggles Drake faces with 
					  Adonis's mother and his internal battles. I do like the piano that follows 
					  the lyrical first half of the song.

					  I like the way this song starts. It drags the intro out with high pitched strings 
					  that wind up and down. I think the lyrics and beat interact pretty well with each 
					  other. I don’t have too many positive things  to say about it.

					  For starters the intro strings are played throughout the song, which I am not a 
					  fan of. I feel like it makes the song feel like one long continuous chorus which 
					  is coupled with Brent’s repeating of the same line. I just get bored fast with 
					  this song, and while the beat is okay, it isn’t enough to save the song. I think 
					  the song had a lot of potential by keeping the intro going during the first verse, 
					  dropping, and then continuing the same intro in the back of the song. Some of the 
					  drums used just don’t sound good at all. I intended to give this a decent rating, 
					  but as I’ve been listening to it I realized it’s just not that good.

					  I’m a big fan of this song. The intro is immediately recognizable and contagious. 
					  My legs just start bouncing. The lyrics are airy which is typical for the Smiths, 
					  but they fit perfectly with the upbeat music. I like the timing of the delivery of 
					  the lyrics too. The chorus varies pace and words are dragged out which is 
					  accompanied by lead guitar. I don’t get bored of this song even after listening to

			  <p class="fontsize container">
				  When I heard that <em>the</em> Michael Cera was a released musician I almost ran around
				  my room. I had first seen him grow up on “Arrested Development” which I absolutely 
				  recommend. It can be found on Netflix, but this is a music review website not a TV show
			      review website. I knew that he played music from a viral meme of him being awkward in
				  public which is in part why I think people like him so much. I feel like he’s awkward
				  without embarrassment which is very difficult for many people. Below is the meme that 
				  I am referencing. I was shocked by what I heard when I listened to his 2014 album for 
				  the first time.

					  Never in a million years would I expect Michael Cera to create such a musical 
					  masterpiece. There is something about how the album hosts such a variety of 
					  sounds and instruments that makes it enjoyable. There are sad piano songs, like 
					  “Moving In” which has a bellowing piano that is muffled but belligerent with 
					  heavy keystrokes. Sidebar that was a crazy description bellowing and belligerent 
					  wow SAT words. The few songs with vocals are folky and the harmonies in combination 
					  with the soft guitar make me feel comfortable like I’m a dog in the sun. I could 
					  only identify Cera’s voice in “Clay Pigeons”, but it’s not terrible. His musical 
					  talent is apparent and I like the vocals he chose in his songs. “Steady Now” is 
					  one of his indie-esk songs which is honestly not bad. Would I add it to my playlist, 
					  no, but I could see others liking it.

					  “What Gives(...I Can’t Live Like This)” is just a series of uncoordinated crashing 
					  and squeaky uncoordinated instruments. Audibly It’s extremely unpleasurable, but it 
					  conveys a story. Cera is tired of living in chaos and noise that doesn’t work together. 
					  Lyrical Genius. I’ve listened to the album a few times and I’m left feeling comforted 
					  and a little confused. I don’t really know what to make of this album: it has no lyrics 
					  and lyrics, piano and guitar, folk and classical. I feel like it suits Cera’s awkward 
					  personality and it is pleasurable to listen to. I just need more time to see if I really 
					  do enjoy it which is why I rated it a check in with me in a few weeks/10.

				  As previously mentioned in my review of Steve Lacy’s album <a href="december20.html#thelofi-s">“The

					  This song is really special. When I first listened to it many years ago I remember being frustrated 
					  that I couldn’t find anything else that sounds like it which you would expect with music. But I 
					  still find myself getting upset that I can’t find more music that matches the  general sound of a 
					  song I like. Anyway, I like the lyrics in this song, in part because they are easy to remember, but 
					  also because the way Lacy sings them is perfectly drawn out and it makes me feel it in my chest when 
					  he sings, “Something baaaaad about to happen to me” perfectly on time with the beat changing from 
					  the drum intro to the full song. I like the drums and the chorus that he sings. Before each verse he 
					  stops the drums and guitar for just a second and then starts the verse. It really is very impressive 
					  that he managed to make this on GarageBand because of the drums and guitar. Mad respect.

					  The intro guitar of this song is insane. There are two guitarists who almost speak to each 
					  other with their rifts. I like how the guitar rift goes from higher to lower and the vocals 
					  remain balanced in the middle. The non-words from the band and the lyrics from the lead 
					  singer, Ezra Koenig, mesh in a beautiful symphony of sound. I really like this song and it 
					  has withstood the test of one year of listening to it which isn’t too bad. I think the song 
					  never gets boring and the constant change in drums and guitar and everything else going on 
					  makes it a really enjoyable listen.

					  The only development I have encountered is that sometimes it doesn’t quite match my mood. 
					  When I want to listen to indie it usually means a more melodic laid back vibe rather than 
					  the exciting rifts that are in the song. It still is a great song, but I have yet to make 
					  a playlist that it fits in, in the right way. Right now it’s my little ugly duckling that 
					  will be beautiful someday. I didn’t give it a higher rating because I’m just not too

					  There are countless BANGERS on this playlist: “Goosebumps”, “sdp Interlude”, “Pick up the 
					  Phone”, “Way Back”, and “Pick up the Phone”. Those 5 songs alone make the album significant 
					  for my music listening history. “Goosebumps” is one of the top 3 most known Travis Scott 
					  songs of all time. “The Ends” and “Way Back” are great songs to start the album with and they 
					  set a good tone for the rest of what you would expect the album to sound like. “Through the 
					  late Night” has a next level Kid Cudi feature that is hidden from the tracklist. Travis often 
					  doesn’t put features in the song title to make his listeners appreciate his music for it’s 
					  quality rather than it’s features which I respect to a high degree.

					  With all the good, there is also a lot of bad like “First Take”, which is not my style at 
					  all. Travis’s vocals are flat. The middle of “lose” is a weird section of the song which 
					  takes away from the potential of the song. “Guidance” isn’t a Travis song in my mind because 
					  it has an upbeat rhythm that doesn’t fit with the album. “Coordinate” isn’t bad, but I think 
					  it doesn't fit into my definition of what Travis’s music sounds like because it has such a weak 
					  beat when he has other songs with outrageous beats which are shown in literally every 
					  “Astroworld” song. Overall, I feel like the album could have some more unity which is the thing 
					  this project lacks when compared to Travis’s other albums.

				  When I listened to “Man on the Moon III”, I listened to the first and second before to set 
				  the tone for the third. This album really is something special. There are songs on this 
				  album that literally <em>made</em> Kid Cudi’s career. This was Cudi’s first album and before 
				  I listened to it, in its entirety of 15 songs on the regular album, I had already listened to 
				  a variety of the songs on “Man on the Moon: The End of Day”.  Cudi is known for his lyrical 
				  genius along with his perfect balance of melodic beats. The album is about dreams which is clear 
				  in the title of the first song “In My Dreams(Cudder Anthem)”.  This being said, when a song has 
				  (nightmare) after it, it is about the nightmares in Cudi’s life and are much darker which is tied 
				  to Mr. Rager who is the darker side of Cudi in Man on the Moon 2. Even 12 years after this album 
				  was released, it still is just as good as the day it was released.

					  This album is in my opinion the best of the trilogy of the “Man on the Moon” releases. 
					  “In My Dreams(Cudder Anthem)” is deeply melodic and the end of the song features a 
					  PSA type announcement from Cudi himself. “Simple As…” is one of my favorite songs on 
					  the album. I love how he makes a beat out of the numbers 1,2, and 3 and the letters a,b,c. 
					  “Solo Dolo(Nightmare)” is eerie but the baseline roots the song down and it creates the 
					  perfect tension. “Day ‘N’ Night(nightmare)” is a notorious college party remix song and 
					  I listened to it many times in my underclassmen years of high school. “Alive(Nightmare)” 
					  and “Cudi Zone” are both top notch songs. “Make Her Say” features “Poker Face” by Lady 
					  Gaga while also hosting a Kanye West feature. “Pursuit of Happiness(Nightmare)” has a 
					  pretty sick guitar solo. “Up Up & Away” is a great way to end the album because it is 
					  very upbeat and completes a cycle from dark to light which is a constant battle in the
					  album and in Cudi’s life.

					  “Heart of a Lion(Kid Cudi Theme)” isn’t my kind of song. It is still a good song, 
					  but I think he has other, better songs. “My World” is a little monotone even though 
					  I like the beat. I don’t think the album is perfect by any means, but I think it’s 
					  damn close. I like most of Cudi’s beats and when he strays too far I think it 
					  doesn’t fit with the flow of the album, but over time he has reeled that in by 
					  releasing more experimental music over time in subsequent albums. Kid Cudi is a rap 
					  god and I think many people recognize his genius and I hope you do too.

				  Kanye probably wrote this in the midst of a bipolar episode… At least I hope he did 
				  because it’s terrible. When this song was released, Kanye believed  that he would win 
				  the 2020 election, which he was not even close to doing and I feel like that chaos 
				  may have pushed him to release this. He has a leaked album called “DONDA” which is 
				  for his mother and everyone would have preferred for him to drop that rather than 
				  this garbage. I still think that you should never doubt Kanye, because he always 
				  turns it around and says “haha look at you, you never should have doubted me. I’m 
				  Kanye!” This clearly isn’t Kanye quality and I hope the next music he releases is 
				  much better. The video below is the music video of the remix of "Nah Nah Nah" which

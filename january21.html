				  In my opinion this album gets way too much hate and there are countless great songs. Compared 
				  to other Travis projects, I think this was a little more rushed than other projects which 
				  were released at a much higher quality. Contrary to belief, I will go on record saying that 
				  I like “Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight” more than “Days Before Rodeo”. I think it is important 
				  to ignore public opinion and make your own opinion about the album.

					  There are countless BANGERS on this playlist: “Goosebumps”, “sdp Interlude”, “Pick up the 
					  Phone”, “Way Back”, and “Pick up the Phone”. Those 5 songs alone make the album significant 
					  for my music listening history. “Goosebumps” is one of the top 3 most known Travis Scott 
					  songs of all time. “The Ends” and “Way Back” are great songs to start the album with and they 
					  set a good tone for the rest of what you would expect the album to sound like. “Through the 
					  late Night” has a next level Kid Cudi feature that is hidden from the tracklist. Travis often 
					  doesn’t put features in the song title to make his listeners appreciate his music for it’s 
					  quality rather than it’s features which I respect to a high degree.

					  With all the good, there is also a lot of bad like “First Take”, which is not my style at 
					  all. Travis’s vocals are flat. The middle of “lose” is a weird section of the song which 
					  takes away from the potential of the song. “Guidance” isn’t a Travis song in my mind because 
					  it has an upbeat rhythm that doesn’t fit with the album. “Coordinate” isn’t bad, but I think 
					  it doesn't fit into my definition of what Travis’s music sounds like because it has such a weak 
					  beat when he has other songs with outrageous beats which are shown in literally every 
					  “Astroworld” song. Overall, I feel like the album could have some more unity which is the thing 
					  this project lacks when compared to Travis’s other albums.

		 <h3 style="color:#3A9DFA">Man on the Moon: The End of Day (I)- 8/10</h3><p>by Kid Cudi</p>
			  <p class="fontsize container">
				  When I listened to “Man on the Moon III”, I listened to the first and second before to set 
				  the tone for the third. This album really is something special. There are songs on this 
				  album that literally <em>made</em> Kid Cudi’s career. This was Cudi’s first album and before 
				  I listened to it, in its entirety of 15 songs on the regular album, I had already listened to 
				  a variety of the songs on “Man on the Moon: The End of Day”.  Cudi is known for his lyrical 
				  genius along with his perfect balance of melodic beats. The album is about dreams which is clear 
				  in the title of the first song “In My Dreams(Cudder Anthem)”.  This being said, when a song has 
				  (nightmare) after it, it is about the nightmares in Cudi’s life and are much darker which is tied 
				  to Mr. Rager who is the darker side of Cudi in Man on the Moon 2. Even 12 years after this album 
				  was released, it still is just as good as the day it was released.

					  This album is in my opinion the best of the trilogy of the “Man on the Moon” releases. 
					  “In My Dreams(Cudder Anthem)” is deeply melodic and the end of the song features a 
					  PSA type announcement from Cudi himself. “Simple As…” is one of my favorite songs on 
					  the album. I love how he makes a beat out of the numbers 1,2, and 3 and the letters a,b,c. 
					  “Solo Dolo(Nightmare)” is eerie but the baseline roots the song down and it creates the 
					  perfect tension. “Day ‘N’ Night(nightmare)” is a notorious college party remix song and 
					  I listened to it many times in my underclassmen years of high school. “Alive(Nightmare)” 
					  and “Cudi Zone” are both top notch songs. “Make Her Say” features “Poker Face” by Lady 
					  Gaga while also hosting a Kanye West feature. “Pursuit of Happiness(Nightmare)” has a 
					  pretty sick guitar solo. “Up Up & Away” is a great way to end the album because it is 
					  very upbeat and completes a cycle from dark to light which is a constant battle in the
					  album and in Cudi’s life.

					  “Heart of a Lion(Kid Cudi Theme)” isn’t my kind of song. It is still a good song, 
					  but I think he has other, better songs. “My World” is a little monotone even though 
					  I like the beat. I don’t think the album is perfect by any means, but I think it’s 
					  damn close. I like most of Cudi’s beats and when he strays too far I think it 
					  doesn’t fit with the flow of the album, but over time he has reeled that in by 
					  releasing more experimental music over time in subsequent albums. Kid Cudi is a rap 
					  god and I think many people recognize his genius and I hope you do too.

		  <h3 style="color:#3A9DFA">Nah Nah Nah- 0/10</h3><p>by Kanye West</p>
			  <p class="fontsize container">
				  Kanye probably wrote this in the midst of a bipolar episode… At least I hope he did 
				  because it’s terrible. When this song was released, Kanye believed  that he would win 
				  the 2020 election, which he was not even close to doing and I feel like that chaos 
				  may have pushed him to release this. He has a leaked album called “DONDA” which is 
				  for his mother and everyone would have preferred for him to drop that rather than 
				  this garbage. I still think that you should never doubt Kanye, because he always 
				  turns it around and says “haha look at you, you never should have doubted me. I’m 
				  Kanye!” This clearly isn’y Kanye quality and I hope the next music he releases is 
				  much better. The video below is the music video of the remix of "Nah Nah Nah" which
				  is better, but not by much. I reviewed the original song just so you know.

					  The only thing I like in the entire song is the fact that Kanye samples Star Wars 
					  Revenge of the Sith when he sings, “Don’t jump Anakin I have the higher ground” 
					  followed by Obi-Wan Kanobi saying it in the movie. I don’t know why he sampled it 
					  and I didn’t think that he could ruin a cinematic masterpiece in such a prosperous 
					  movie franchise, but he did it.
				  </p>

					  I cannot find a single thing to say that could save this song. The beat is uncoordinated 
					  with a flute. I don’t think I even need to justify why I gave it a 0, if you can’t 
					  understand why, you better start listening to my recommendations because it is absolutely 
					  terrible.

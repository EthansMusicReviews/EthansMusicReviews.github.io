      <h3>Chandelier 7/10</h3>
      <h1>By Will Paquin</h1>
      <p class="container" style="text-size:15px">Paquin began his music career on tik tok when he posted a video sitting on a porch with a sunset
      in the background. I remember scrolling on my for you page and feeling an unusual comfort when he played his
       first draft of his first song "Chandelier". I like the song and listen all the way through each time, but I 
       enjoyed the stripped down version better with just vocals

      <h3>Talkhouse Podcast - 6/10</h3>
      <p  class="containter" style="font-size:15px">The talkhouse podcast is a true treat for any indie lover. Instagram ads blessed me and advertised that 
      Mac Demarco, one of my favorite artists, had a podcast with Dayglow an artist that I knew <em>of</em> but not about. 
      In the podcast, the two artists discuss touring, the impact of COVID on the industry, and various other topics. Demarco becomes a big brother type of figure
      during the podcast by imparting tidbits of information with young Dayglow yet they also can share a laugh over their work. I enjoyed it, but found it to be a little slow at times,
      but that is what comes with Indie artists and it is always nice to slow down in the bustle and hustle of every day.</p>

      <h3>Savage Mode 2 - 2/10</h3>
      <p  class="containter" style="font-size:15px">Metro Boomin and 21 Savage released their much anticipated follow up to the iconic album
      "Savage Mode", and I was sadly underwhelmed. Their first album yielded songs that are still on my playlist nearly
      four and a half years later like "X" and "Savage Mode". In their second album, I found the intro "Intro" featuring Morgan Freedman to be the best part of 
      the album. The track "Mr. Right Now" featuring Drake has a weird high pitched beat mixed with 808's and hi-hats. In my opinion without 
      the main beat, it would have been a hit. Overall disappointed and skipped most of the songs in the album. </p>

							As I said, the guitar and drums in this song are absolutely 
									phenomenal. The vocals are throaty and strong especially for 
									an indie song. This is the kind of song that I would listen

									summer or if I’m feeling good. It is a pretty solid song.

							I have to acknowledge that Indie music doesn’t typically have 
									verses like in Rap, but I feel like this song focused more 
									on the instrumental solos rather than vocals. There are long 
									gaps between the choruses which have phenomenal drum and 
									guitar solos, but I feel like the song drags out a little 
									bit. That being said, it’s not a bad song it just isn’t 
									perfectly my taste and I wouldn’t listen to it on loop like 
									I would with some other songs.

							Good songs on “Slime Language 2 are hard to come by. Features 
									on the other hand are bountiful and out in force. I don’t 
									think a single song has less than two features. “Ski” and 
									“Solid” are the only two good songs in the album. “Ski” has 
									a great strings based backing track and half decent vocals. 
									The song isn’t trying to do too much, but the subtle 808’s 
									make it fit in the rap genre well. “Solid” has a Drake feature 
									which made it an instant hit. There is no artist in the history 
									of the Rap industry who has the same hit factor that Drake 
									does. Whatever he touches turns to diamond. I think that he 
									had a lot of influence on the song and it seems more like his 
									song than anyone else’s. The sneaky 808’s and claps are 
									absolutely disgusting. Young Thug rounds the vocals out with 
									his deep voice and makes it the best song on the album.

							There are too many songs to pick out each flaw in this album. 
									“Como Te Llama”, “Superstar”, and “Reckless” are laughable 
									how bad they are. An overarching problem with the album is 
									that there isn’t a sole artist besides Young Stoner Life who 
									produced all the songs. I really couldn’t even listen to the 
									full album, it was that bad. If 2 of 23 songs in the album 
									are good, something is clearly wrong and I think that anyone 
									who actually likes this entire album might need to clean their 
									ears out.

							The best part of this song in the intro. The smooth cut 
									baseline mixes so well with the drums and classic turntable 
									sound. The vocals are art with the call and response of  
									“Can I kick it? Yes ya can.” The baseline is stripped during 
									the verse and all that’s left is the vocals and the drums. 
									The turntable sound captures the music of A Tribe Called 
									Quest’s prime and I enjoy the nostalgia. Also, the intro is 
									repeated as different vocalists start their verses which I 
									really like. The cutting of the beat in the second vocalists 
									verse around 2:40 is just so nice and it keeps the song fresh 
									even three minutes in. 
							</p> 
					
				<h4 style="color:gray">Dislikes:</h4> 
							<p class="fontsize"> 
							There is one part of the song around 1:30 that does not float 
									my boat. I think the song and what sounds like synthesised 
									piano pitches up a little too much for my liking. A drum solo 
									or something that fits with the beat may work better, or 
									maybe not because the higher pitch serves as a break for the 
									song which keeps it original. Regardless this is a classic 
									and should be respected as such.

							I found that I liked the beat of a lot of the songs that were 
									released, but the vocals and other instruments let some of 
									the songs down. The beat of “Chain On” was so funky and had 
									so much potential with strong vocals. “Bankroll” absolutely 
									goes. The features of A$AP Rocky and A$AP Ferg bring this 
									song to another level with Brockhampton member Merlin opening 
									the song with strong vocals and his deep voice. The beat has 
									a halloween feel, but the other instruments and the catchy 
									ukulele cover the beat and make this one of the best songs 
									on the album. “The Light” also has a great beat that is 
									intro’d by a sick guitar riff. “What’s the Occasion?” I am a 
									fan of, but don’t quite know what playlist to add it to. 
									“When I Ball” samples string instruments which adds another 
									dimension to the song, but it just doesn’t belong in one of 
									my playlists. “Don’t Shoot Up the Party” has been bumping on 
									my Spotify since the drop of the album on April 9th. The beat 
									leads in so well to the drop at 40 seconds with some ringing 
									sound that is signature to Brockhampton. The continuous beat 
									works well in this song as a result of the various vocals and 
									instruments added on.

							I really want to give this album a higher ranking, but while

							Unfortunately, I feel like this song falls in a few places. I

									and ending are almost 20 seconds each and the chorus takes a

			<h3 style="color:white">I’m Loving Your Vibe Original - 4/10</h3><p style="color:white">by Xavier Goodman</p> 
				<p class="fontsize"> 
				I found this song on my Tik Tok and genuinely thought it was Tyler the 
						Creator at first. I listened to some of the full album released after 
						this single, and decided not to review it because I was drawn to this 
						song more than any other. Some brief background info onXavier Goodman is 
						that he is an up and coming artist and this song landed in the top 10 new 
						songs of the week on Spotify!

							<p class="fontsize"> 
							I like that the beat and the female vocals sound very 
										melodic and Tyler-like. It sounds like it is sampled 
										from the album “Flower Boy”, but I’m not sure. I like 
										the bars and think that there is a ton of potential, but 
										this song just isn’t too phenomenal. I think that the 
										main attraction to this song is the beat, and not the 
										vocals which is concerning for his future as an artist. 
							</p> 
					
				<h4 style="color:gray">Dislikes:</h4> 
							<p class="fontsize"> 
							I know that as a new artist, Xavier likely doesn’t have 
										the quality recording equipment that so many artists use 
										and that I am used to, but his sounds really bad. I feel 
										like the mixing made the vocals way too loud over the beat 
										during his verses. His voice also whines rather than 
										drags when he sings during the chorus which I find to be 
										annoying.

				<p class="fontsize"> 
				When I tell you this is Will Paquin’s best release, I mean it. This 
						release on April 2nd followed the same format as the last release and 
						I liked it. I don’t have much to say except I’m excited to review this 
						song.

				<h4 style="color:gray">Likes:</h4>
							<p class="fontsize"> 
							Maybe the main fingerpicking rift for the past two songs 
										was too similar, but I feel like this was a new sound 
										that Will didn’t complicate or ruin with other instruments. 
										He kept it raw with angelic harmonies and soft vocals. I 
										have been waiting for him to release and this didn’t 
										disappoint. I like the regular version, but the striped 
										one in the video above is beyond perfect. 
							</p> 
					
				<h4 style="color:gray">Dislikes:</h4> 
							<p class="fontsize"> 
							I really can’t think of any complaints about this song. I 
										think that it deserves the 10/10 because he kept it 
										stripped. I have listened to it on loop, and it doesn’t 
										get old. I think this is exactly what I hoped from the 
										demo video on Tik Tok and I am ecstatic about this song.

			<h3 style="color:white">10% - 7/10</h3><p style="color:white">by KAYTRANADA (ft. Kali Uchis)</p> 
				<p class="fontsize"> 
				I came across this song because MostlyMusic recommended it in a Tik Tok, and it did 
			not disappoint. I like the good vibes and high energy in this song, and Kali Uchis is 
			a well known artist, so I was excited to listen for the first time. Since then it has 
			become one of my favorite songs to bump in the car.

				<h4 style="color:gray">Likes:</h4>
							<p class="fontsize"> 
							I like the upbeat baseline and drums in this song. The chorus is more 
							contagious than COVID, no joke. The guitar is outer-spacey and I like 
							the poppy sound of the song.  
							</p> 
					
				<h4 style="color:gray">Dislikes:</h4> 
							<p class="fontsize"> 
							My only critique is that the song doesn’t vary too much so it can be 
							slightly repetitive which took a few points off my ranking.

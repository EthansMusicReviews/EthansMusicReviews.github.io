							The best part of this song in the intro. The smooth cut 
							baseline mixes so well with the drums and classic turntable 
							sound. The vocals are art with the call and response of  
							“Can I kick it? Yes ya can.” The baseline is stripped during 
							the verse and all that’s left is the vocals and the drums. 
							The turntable sound captures the music of A Tribe Called 
							Quest’s prime and I enjoy the nostalgia. Also, the intro is 
							repeated as different vocalists start their verses which I 
							really like. The cutting of the beat in the second vocalists 
							verse around 2:40 is just so nice and it keeps the song fresh 
							even three minutes in.
							</p> 
					
				<h4 style="color:gray">Dislikes:</h4> 
							<p class="fontsize"> 
							There is one part of the song around 1:30 that does not float 
							my boat. I think the song and what sounds like synthesised 
							piano pitches up a little too much for my liking. A drum solo 
							or something that fits with the beat may work better, or 
							maybe not because the higher pitch serves as a break for the 
							song which keeps it original. Regardless this is a classic 
							and should be respected as such.

				To preface this review, Brockhampton is a boy band with nearly 26 members. 
				This often leads to some pretty loosely related songs with different

							I found that I liked the beat of a lot of the songs that were 
							released, but the vocals and other instruments let some of 
							the songs down. The beat of “Chain On” was so funky and had 
							so much potential with strong vocals. “Bankroll” absolutely 
							goes. The features of A$AP Rocky and A$AP Ferg bring this 
							song to another level with Brockhampton member Merlin opening 
							the song with strong vocals and his deep voice. The beat has 
							a halloween feel, but the other instruments and the catchy 
							ukulele cover the beat and make this one of the best songs 
							on the album. “The Light” also has a great beat that is 
							intro’d by a sick guitar riff. “What’s the Occasion?” I am a 
							fan of, but don’t quite know what playlist to add it to. 
							“When I Ball” samples string instruments which adds another 
							dimension to the song, but it just doesn’t belong in one of 
							my playlists. “Don’t Shoot Up the Party” has been bumping on 
							my Spotify since the drop of the album on April 9th. The beat 
							leads in so well to the drop at 40 seconds with some ringing 
							sound that is signature to Brockhampton. The continuous beat 
							works well in this song as a result of the various vocals and 
							instruments added on.
							</p> 
					
				<h4 style="color:gray">Dislikes:</h4> 
							<p class="fontsize"> 
							I really want to give this album a higher ranking, but while 
							there may be versatility in the kind of sound in each song, 
							there isn't in the playlists that the songs belong in. I find 
							it hard to add multiple songs to one of my playlists and it 
							really sucks because I really do like some of the songs in 
							this album but there isn’t a group of songs that sound the 
							same. It makes me think about doing a playlist restructuring 
							in the near future.

							There are two good things about this song. The first is the 
							minecraft beat which actually is insanely hard. Secondly, 
							there is a lyric at 39 seconds when $tatic Gooz says “B***h,

							Bad, bad, bad. The effort is clearly there but the artists 
							can’t sing at more than one pitch and the monotone rapping

							and that’s all it ever will be. Don’t take it seriously and

							Unfortunately, I feel like this song falls in a few places. I 
							know that I can’t hold a leak to the same standards as a full 
							release because Juice didn’t have opportunity to finish the 
							song out. That is why I feel like it is incomplete. The intro 
							and ending are almost 20 seconds each and the chorus takes a 
							long time so the verses feel incomplete. The drums are good, 
							but there still could have been another element added to the 
							song. I feel like a feature would round the song out well, but

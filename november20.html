      <h3>Pixel Bath - 4/10</h3><p>by Jean Dawson</p>
      <p class="fontsize" id="container">
      Pixel Bath and Jean Dawson came as a surprise to me just this week. I was looking through some new music and found 
      the song "Triple Double" featuring ASAP Rocky which piqued my interest. I have yet to dive into all of Dawson's music 
      but it sounds like a typical indie album with low-fi beats as backing to most of his songs. The more and more I listen 
      to the 13 songs on the artist's second full album. I would give Dawson a listen and keep a lookout for his name on some 
      up and coming music.

      <p id="container" class="fontsize">This album was a very pleasant surprise after I was preparing 
      to write about "Triple Double" because of the great ASAP Rocky feature. I decided to listen to the rest of the album 
      and it maintained its overall indie feel. "Pyrotechnics" is one of my favorite songs. I really enjoy how he layered his 
      own vocals over a different vocal track. It is the perfect song to play in the background while you do homework or 
      talk to someone on the phone.
      </p>
      <center><h4>Dislikes:</h4></center>
      <p id="container" class="fontsize">While I did enjoy the album I can easily find myself 
      getting bored of most of his songs because of their un-originality of backing music. Additionally, one of the songs 
      in the album, "bleanfjlf" hosts scream singing which I find to be untalented and unenjoyable. Another scream rap song is 
      "06 Burst" which did bring down my rating for the album as a whole. I think that because Dawson is such a new 
      artist, he needs time to mature and work through some of his different sounds in his music. For someone
      who released his song in 2018 I have high hopes for Dawson, but hope he digs deeper into Indie tracks than scream rap. 
      Additionally, 13 songs and 38 minutes is a very brief album and in my opinion it is worth it to wait longer for 
      more quality music at once than multiple small projects.

      <h3>Beautiful Havoc - 7/10</h3><p>by $not</p>
      <p class="container" class="fontsize">
      $not(pronounced snot) is an up and coming rapper. I uncovered his aggressive rap through Tik Tok where his song 
      "Moon and Stars" from his 2020 album "Tragedy" went viral. With high expectations following his previous
      album release, Beautiful Havoc didn't overwhelm or underwhelm me. One of the most notable things about $not, is 
      that even though his popularity is increasing, his social media feels intimate. He treats his fans like close 
      friends sharing when he is up late or lonely. It humanizes a mildly popular rapper and I hope other fans appreciate 
      it as much as I do. A fun fact to note is that he rarely ever appears out without a hoodie over his head 
      pulled tight around his face which can be seen in the image below.

      <p id="container" class="fontsize"> There are multiple songs on this album that I added
      to my playlist after the first album and continue to listen to multiple times a week. "Revenge" took a little while to
      grow on me but is now a song that I look forward to when it circles around my music que. "Who Do I Trust" similarly 
      has taken some time to appreciate but overall I don't skip the song when it comes on. The upbeat backing beats with 
      heavy 808's pull most of $not's songs together with his deep monotone rapping to create a concrete album. There is one
      song from this album that I consider to be pure art: "Sangria" featuring Denzel Curry. I love the beat and the vocals
      with the addition of Denzel Curry's feature makes it my favorite song in the Album. The features and  beats show great
      improvement from $not's last album and I can 100% confirm that I am a fan.
     </p>
     <center><h4>Dislikes:</h4></center>
      <p id="container" class="fontsize">For $not, a relatively new artist, to put 24 songs
      out in two albums in one year is impressive, but I would have preferred him to release one full length album with 
      20 of his best songs. By releasing so much new music, I feel like some songs feel rushed and could have been true 
      hits. Certain songs like "4" didn't seem to fit in the album and I think the album could have been better if $not had
      worked on the song more. "Havoc" slowed the pace of the album down for no reason when $not could have really pulled the 
      album to a close after "Mean" featuring FloMilli. $not does have a generally monotone rapping style which can be 
      repetitive, but his varying beats help to make each song feel new. While I do appreciate the music he did release, I 
      wish $not could have waited to release this album and worked on some of the songs more.

      <h3>Can We - 6/10</h3><p>by Jim-E-Stack ft Kacy Hill</p>
      <p class="container" class="fontsize">
      Both Jim-E-Stack and Kacy Hill have impressive resumes in the music industry. Jim-E-Stack is a respected producer 
      and Kacy Hill was featured on Travis Scott's "90210" arguably one of the best rap songs from the last decade. Released
      as one song in Stack's album, "Can We" came across my Tik Tok when an account, <a href="spotify:user:1230826440">MostlyMusic</a>, posted the top 10 indie-pop 
      songs of the week. I highly recommend that you check out his Spotify which is liked by clicking his username. The song
      was more of an exploration of the potential that Hill has as a vocal artist.

      <p id="container" class="fontsize">For a solo I found the song to be lighthearted and 
      enjoyable. Hill's vocals are simple and her humming is delightful on the ears. Stacks's superb producing yields a song
      with a solid beat and a perfectly placed breakdown with just the right mix of drums bass and symbols. I truly enjoyed
      the production of this song and the vocals fit nicely. 
     </p>
     <center><h4>Dislikes:</h4></center>
      <p id="container" class="fontsize">Personally, I find the song to be too light for 
      my own listening. The upbeat drop from Stack's production doesn't mix with my preferred taste in music. Because my 
      rankings are based on my personal preference I couldn't give this a perfect rating although I'm sure there are people
      who will enjoy this song to it's full potential.

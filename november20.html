      <h3>Pixel Bath - 6/10</h3><p>by Jean Dawson</p>
      <p class="container" style="font-size:18px">
      Pixel Bath and Jean Dawson came as a surprise to me just this week. I was looking through some new music and found 
      the song "Triple Double" featuring ASAP Rocky which peaked my interest. I have yet to dive into all of Dawson's music 
      but it sounds like a typical indie album with low-fi beats as backing to most of his songs.

	  <h4> Likes and Dislikes </h4>
      <p id="container" style="font-size:18px"><center>Likes:</center>This album was a very pleasant surprise after I was preparing 
      to write about "Triple Double" because of the great ASAP Rocky feature. I decided to listen to the rest of the album 
      and it maintained its overall indie feel.  
      </p>
      <p id="container" style="font-size:18px"><center>Dislikes:</center>While I did enjoy the album I can easily find myself 
      getting bored of most of his songs because of their un-originality of backing music. Additionally, one of the songs 
      in the album, "bleanfjlf" hosts scream singing which I find to be untalented and unenjoyable.

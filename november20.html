      <h3 style="color:#3A9DFA">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy - 7/10</h3><p>by Kanye West</p>
		  <p class="fontsize container">
			  November 22nd 2020 marked the 10th anniversary of Kanye West’s album “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy”. MBDTF 
			  has endured a decade of music listeners, and still hasn’t gotten old. In my eyes, as a member of Gen Z,  this 
			  album dropped before I started listening to rap, but it’s not old enough to be a part of the classic rap genre 
			  or new enough to be considered rap from my generation. I feel that your “generation of rap” is the years of 
			  late middle school to post college, which MBDTF is not in. This album was Kanye’s 5th album, and I think it 
			  stands out because of Kanye’s vocals as a drastic change from the synths and pitch changing used in his previous
			  album, “808’s and Heartbreak”. There are some of the most widely known hits on this album and I’m honored to 
			  review it.

				  The greatest highlight of this album is indisputably “Runaway”. This song 
				  is a classic heartbreak anthem which is heard through lyrics like “And I know I did damage, cuz that look in 
				  ya eyes is killing me”. The piano keystrokes are recognizable by the first note. I can’t formulate the words 
				  to explain how I feel about “Runaway” but I can feel each beat in my chest. There are many other top tier songs
				  on this album like “Devil in a New Dress” featuring Rick Ross in what I believe to be his best feature of all 
				  time. “POWER” is one of the best songs to get pumped up for a sports event or a workout at the gym. “Gorgeous” 
				  features Kid Cudi and a contagious beat. As a whole, this album must be respected for the new direction that 
				  Kanye steered the rap/hip hop industry towards and the sheer number of hits that came from this album even 10 
				  years later.

			  <p class="fontsize container">
				  While I do really enjoy most of the songs on this album, there are a few that 
				  don’t align with my music taste. I feel like the length of the songs is extreme and I can get bored easily. 
				  For example, “Runaway” is 9 minutes and 7 seconds. That is the length of a short youtube video in 2020 and to
				  be honest I find it hard to not skip through the album when the songs are about half way through. “Who Will 
				  Survive in America” is a little interesting as there are no Kanye vocals, but a church sermon sampling. I don’t
				  dislike songs on MBDTF, they simply don’t fit in my music taste but I can absolutely respect the quality of 
				  music that Kanye produced.

		  <p class="fontsize container">
			  Men I Trust is a very very mellow indie pop band. This band proves my theory that Canadian musicians are in 
			  some cases more talented than American artists in the indie industry ex: Mac Demarco. I find all of this band’s 
			  music to be perfect when doing basically anything at night like driving or doing homework. There are numerous 
			  great songs in this Men I Trust’s discography like “Seven” and “Tailwhip”. I find the sound of their music to 
			  be similar to Clairo and will admit that while I am not a hardcore fan, I do enjoy their music.

				  I absolutely love the intro to this song. The way the drums roll into the beat of 
				  the song is so pleasing to my ears, and the soft vocals give me a sense of comfort. Airy vocals, light drums, and a 
				  solid baseline tie this song together and make it the perfect song to daydream to. I find myself lost in the 
				  simplistic beat, and think the song is solid overall.

				  There isn’t anything that I dislike about the song, it’s rather what the 
				  song lacks. I feel like it drags on for its duration which isn’t a bad thing because it is very melodic, but 
				  I find myself losing track of the song. I think the beat is so soft and simplistic that the soft focals let me 
				  drift my attention away from the song. If that is what you are looking for in music then this is a great song 
				  for you to listen to.

		  <p class="fontsize container">
			  There is no doubt in my mind Frank Ocean is the most respected rap artist in the rap industry today. Unlike 
			  many other concerts in the past decade, videos of Ocean’s concerts show almost no one recording the performance. 
			  Other artists like Rex Orange County will not cover Frank Ocean songs out of respect. The next time another artist 
			  has reached the level of success and respect that he has, pigs will fly. Although his music drops are extremely 
			  infrequent, Ocean produces a quality of music that is unmatched by anyone in the industry which is shown in his 
			  multiple albums and solo releases which will be covered on this website in the future.

				  The beginning of “Lens” starts off with thoughtful lyrics and a very likeable 
				  beat. This calm beginning then completely changes when the beat drops at a minute and 45 seconds. The new backing 
				  makes me feel like I’m floating. I really like this song, but it becomes 100 times better when you listen to “Lens 
				  v2” which features an unreleased Travis Scott feature. It was shown to me after listening to the regular version 
				  for over a year and to this day I mainly listen to the unreleased version.

				  I have no problem with the techniques that Ocean used to make “Lens” but it 
				  feels incomplete without the Travis Scott verse. In my mind the song is very slow to reach the beat drop and when 
				  it does drop, it’s very mellow. However, the feature fixes this and adds an upbeat ending with heavy hitting Travis 
				  lyrics. Every time I listen to the regular version I wait for the feature which never comes, which is why I gave 
				  this song the rating I did.

		  <p class="fontsize container">
			  This album is by far one of my favorite albums of all time. To start, it has features like Rex Orange County, Frank Ocean, and Steve 
			  Lacy. The songs are unlike any other and each tells a story different from the one before it. This was the first album that introduced
			  my appreciation for Tyler and changed my taste in music from Rap, like Travis Scott's "Astroworld", to more relaxed Rap, like Frank Ocean. 
			  I find Tyler's personality to shine right through in his music which is both amusing and creative. A fun fact is that Tyler doesn't 
			  like how deep his voice is, so in almost all of his songs, he pitches his voice up using a keyboard.

				  I initially didn't listen to all of the songs in this album as a whole. Instead I had heard songs like "Boredom" and "See You Again"
				  which still remain two of my favorite songs on the album. One thing that is blatantly obvious when you look at the track list is 
				  the variety and quantity of features. Features include Rex Orange County, Kali Uchis, Frank Ocean, A$AP Rocky, Steve Lacy, Lil Wayne,
				  Anna of the North, Jaden Smith, and Estelle give a very wide variety of vocal ranges to each song. Certain songs are good to get hyped 
				  up to like "Who Dat Boy" which still manages to make me jump in my seat when I watch videos of it being performed at concerts. 
				  Overall, the majority of the songs in this album are in my playlist and will be for a very long time, not to mention the other 
				  great Tyler the Creator albums, "Igor", "Wolf", "Goblin", and "Cherry Bomb". This album shaped my Sophomore year and my life for the
				  indefinite future.

      <center><h4 style="color:#3A9DFA">Dislikes:</h4></center>
			  <p class="fontsize container"> 
				  While I do love most of the album, there are a few songs that I dislike. To begin, "Sometimes" is just a weird sample that fits with 
				  Tyler's personality but disrupts the flow of the album. I like "Who Dat Boy" but I feel like it doesn't really mesh with the other 
				  songs of the album. The music I listen to usually fits with my mood and I don't like to go from "See You Again" a relaxing song 
				  to the aggressive yelling in "Who Dat Boy". Similarly, "I Ain't Got Time!" just is so abstract and simply is too weird for me. 
				  There is no way to describe it so I would recommend that you give it a listen yourself because it is unlike any other song on
				  the album and doesn't fit at all in my opinion. In the scope of the rest of Tyler's music this album is simply not his best, but 
				  it does house some of my favorite songs.

				  I cannot say enough as to how much I love this song. Throughout the 
				  multiple changes of my music interests, “Mile High” has consistently remained as one of my favorite songs. 
				  I can’t say exactly why it doesn’t have the popularity of other Travis Scott features, but I appreciate that 
				  there is one song that Scott’s millions of fans haven’t blown up for the whole world to listen to.

				  The only thing that I dislike about this song is that it is one of a kind and 
				  I don’t think a song like it will ever be created. James Blake doesn’t top this song in his album and I feel like 
				  the way he and Scott harmonize will not interlock with the Metro Boomin beat to create such a beautiful symphony. 
				  I previously rated this a 10/10 but after consideration have lowered it to a 9/10 because it doesn't make me feel the 
				  things that the other 10/10's do.

				  There are too many good things to say about this album. I can't pick a favorite song because each and every one is phenomenal. 
				  For a frame of reference "Go Easy" and "Chamber of Reflections" were at the time my favorite Mac songs, but then my entire ranking
				  system was flipped upside-down. "Still Beating" was the first Indie song I learned on guitar and "This Old Dog" made me the fan that
				  I am today. In the video above, Mac walks through a park in France and I cannot imagine a more perfect, serene video. "Moonlight 
				  on the River" put me in a trance with it's melodic beats and guitar accents. Lastly, "A Wolf Who Wears Sheeps Clothes" consistently
				  can turn a bad day into a good one. Out of all Demarco's albums, this one has no skips.

				  This album was a very pleasant surprise after I was preparing 
				  to write about "Triple Double" because of the great ASAP Rocky feature. I decided to listen to the rest of the album 
				  and it maintained its overall indie feel. "Pyrotechnics" is one of my favorite songs. I really enjoy how he layered his 
				  own vocals over a different vocal track. It is the perfect song to play in the background while you do homework or 
				  talk to someone on the phone.

				  While I did enjoy the album I can easily find myself 
				  getting bored of most of his songs because of their un-originality of backing music. Additionally, one of the songs 
				  "06 Burst" hosts scream singing which I find to be untalented and unenjoyable. I think that because Dawson is such a new 
				  artist, he needs time to mature and work through some of his different sounds in his music. For someone
				  who released his song in 2018 I have high hopes for Dawson, but hope he digs deeper into Indie tracks than scream rap. 
				  Additionally, 13 songs and 38 minutes is a very brief album and in my opinion it is worth it to wait longer for 
				  more quality music at once than multiple small projects.

				  out in two albums in one year is impressive, but I would have preferred him to release one full length album with 
				  20 of his best songs. By releasing so much new music, I feel like some songs feel rushed and could have been true 
				  hits. Certain songs like "4" didn't seem to fit in the album and I think the album could have been better if $not had
				  worked on the song more. "Havoc" slowed the pace of the album down for no reason when $not could have really pulled the 
				  album to a close after "Mean" featuring FloMilli. $not does have a generally monotone rapping style which can be 
				  repetitive, but his varying beats help to make each song feel new. While I do appreciate the music he did release, I 
				  wish $not could have waited to release this album and worked on some of the songs more.

      <h3 style="color:#3A9DFA">Can We - 5/10</h3><p>by Jim-E-Stack ft. Kacy Hill</p>
		  <p class="fontsize container">
			  Both Jim-E-Stack and Kacy Hill have impressive resumes in the music industry. Jim-E-Stack is a respected producer 
			  and Kacy Hill was featured on Travis Scott's "90210" arguably one of the best rap songs from the last decade. Released
			  as one song in Stack's album, "Can We" came across my Tik Tok when an account, <a href="spotify:user:1230826440">MostlyMusic</a>, posted the top 10 indie-pop 
			  songs of the week. I highly recommend that you check out his Spotify which is liked by clicking his username. The song
			  was more of an exploration of the potential that Hill has as a vocal artist.

				  For a solo I found the song to be lighthearted and 
				  enjoyable. Hill's vocals are simple and her humming is delightful on the ears. Stacks's superb producing yields a song
				  with a solid beat and a perfectly placed breakdown with just the right mix of drums, bass, and symbols. I truly enjoyed
				  the production of this song and the vocals fit nicely.

			  <p class="fontsize container">
				  Personally, I find the song to be too light for 
				  my own listening. The upbeat drop from Stack's production doesn't mix with my preferred taste in music. Because my 
				  rankings are based on my personal preference I couldn't give this a perfect rating although I'm sure there are people
				  who will enjoy this song to it's full potential.

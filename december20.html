      <h3>Man on the Moon III - 9/10</h3><p>by Kid Cudi</p>
      <p class="fontsize container">
      To prepare myself to listen to this album, starting at 9:50 at night, I listened to Man on the Moon 1
       then immediately after, Man on the Moon 2 which perfectly aligned with the release of Man on the Moon 3.
        I put my noise canceling Beat Studio 3’s on, put my phone down just sat and listened. Kid Cudi created 
        art and I haven’t been able to stop listening to it. I even made my dad listen to it with me, and he enjoyed it.

	  I liked a lot of the songs on this album, starting with “Tequila Shots”, which is my favorite song off the album. The synth sounds, floaty beat centered by drums, and Cudi’s magical humming and vocals make it irresistible to not bounce your head. The next song “Another Day” initially was not my favorite, but after my third time listening to the album I have come around and now really enjoy the beat and lyrics. Cudi’s deep voice couples really well with his beats and I think this song specifically varies the beat and vocals perfectly. “Dive” has a great beat, but I think there are better songs on the album. “Damaged” and “Heaven on Earth” are perfect songs for the gym but I wouldn’t listen just for pleasure on my day to day. “Mr.Solo Dolo III” is another favorite from the album and I like how the beat is mellow which fits my music taste. “Elsie’s Baby Boy(flashback)” samples “The House of the Rising Sun” by the Animals which I can appreciate. “The Void” is another great song in my opinion as the song almost drops you into the void of the song when Cudi starts with his melodic humming and then the beat comes in abruptly.  “Lord I Know” has a really cool distorted beat and was my dad’s favorite song on the album. Every time I listen to this album I like it more and more and keep adding songs to my playlists.

      There were very few songs that I disliked on this album and the list gets smaller and smaller each time I listen to it. The three exceptions to this rule are “Beautiful Trip”,  “She Knows This”, and “Rockstar Nights” with Trippie Redd. I find that “Beautiful Trip” sets the scene for the album, but doesn’t contribute to the overall album. When you listen to it in order, it creates some hype but I would never add it to a playlist. “She Knows This” just has a weird beat with off tempo strong 808 hits that contrast strongly with the other melodic songs on the album. Cudi’s vocals are almost the same song but the beat is too atrocious to recover from. Lastly, “Rockstar Nights” feels more like a Trippie Redd song than a Kid Cudi song and the same goes for “Show Out” which is literally a Pop Smoke song in the album and absolutely doesn’t belong in the album. I like Pop Smoke, but I think all of his songs sound the same and that’s a hot take. Although I have problems with this album, I had to rate it near perfect because I haven’t enjoyed an album this much in a long time.

      <h3>Cinematic Sounds - 6/10</h3><p>by Homesick Locations</p>
      <p class="fontsize container">
      For a new young band, releasing new music is often uncoordinated and not fully developed, but Homesick Locations is an exception to that trend. I know two members of the band, Ethan Bauman and Hayden Sirpis who are both lifelong musicians. I’ve heard them play on their own, but was blown away by their first EP.  I am so beyond proud to know some of the band members and I hope that they get more exposure as time goes on. They are trying to reach 5 thousand streams before December 31st, so <b>PLEASE</b> listen!

	 As a whole I think the EP is diverse in sound and I think that the vocals have real feelings behind them. “Wassup” has my favorite progression in the EP as the song picks up gradually and the echoing of vocals has a really great effect. “Mr.Miller Lite” is so airy accompanied by some great guitar soloing. The vocals are my favorite on the whole project and the verse starting at one minute is impressive for the first project released by Homesick Locations. “Pineapple Fanta” is a very fun song with classic pop indie music that reminds me of the band Wallows. I like the way that the vocals work with the rest of the song. There is no doubt in my mind that I would eat up any more music released by Homesick Locations, and I think that the band has real potential to blow up especially in this era of music because of social media’s influence on the success of bands.

      <p class="fontsize container"> There are only a few knit-picky dislikes I have about the album. I think a little less distortion on some of the vocals could do a lot in “Wassup” and I could do without the metronome sounding claves in the start of the “Mr. Miller Lite”, but at the same time I like them at certain times in the song. My main dislike of this EP is that it’s so short and I want more! Please, please, please go listen and share with a friend. With decent exposure I think this band could really go places.

      <h3>Chanel - 10/10</h3><p>by Frank Ocean</p>
      <p class="fontsize container">
      As previously mentioned, Frank Ocean is the father of pop rap. I think that he is the most widely
       respected artist which is best shown by Rex Orange County’s refusal to cover his music. Ocean is 
       a musical genius and “Chanel” was the first song that I listened to. I think that to interpret any 
       of Frank Ocean’s music for someone else is a sin and for that reason I’ll let you go on to my 
       review of this absolute piece of art.

	  I think that the main allure of this song is it’s lyrics. Right out of the gate Ocean sings, “My guy 
	  pretty like a girl” which feeds into the theme of sexuality within the song. Another amazing lyric
	   that has two meanings almost like a homonym: “I see both sides like Chanel” and “See on both
	    sides like Chanel”. The two lines sound the same in the song but have entirely different meanings 
	    which shows how talented Ocean is. There are too many amazing lyrics to feature and I could write 
	    about them forever, but I think part of the enjoyment is your own interpretation of the music. The 
	    beat is melodic but addicting and it never is overly repetitive. I think it has a great balance
	     between the music and the vocals. That’s just mentioning the regular “Chanel” which cut out an 
	     A$AP Rocky feature. In the unreleased version Rocky sings a lyric that raises questions of his 
	     own sexuality, “Was such a good gut to Chanel, ‘Til she caught me sleeping with Charel”. This 
	     verse completely blindsided me, but I really only like his verse for just that one line because 
	     the released version is amazing.

      I don’t have a single dislike for this song. I genuinely love every aspect of the song and don’t have a 
      single bit of criticism and that is why I rated it a 10/10.

      <h3>Dark Knight Dummo - 8/10</h3><p>by Trippie Redd ft. Travis Scott</p>
      <p class="fontsize container">
      Sunday December 6th marks the three year anniversary (December 6th, 2017) of the release of
       “Dark Knight Dummo”, an iconic Trippie Redd song featuring Travis Scott. 2017 was a magical
        year of rap and this only added to my music fever. I think of this song synonymous with 
        “Astroworld” and seeing it performed live was a true treat. Trippie Redd isn’t my favorite
         artist but I do enjoy this song of his. The Travis feature fits perfectly with the song and
          I hope I can listen to it in college and enjoy every beat with nostalgia and happiness.

	  This song is good to immediately get hyped up at a party ex: a Bar Mitzvah or at the gym. I 
	  think that the high energy ties perfectly into Scott’s energy, adlibs, and auto tuned vocals. 
	  The lyric “Astroworld, my planet my home” was the first mention I had ever heard about 
	  “Astroworld” which segued me into a new phase in my music listening career. The beginning 
	  of the song when Trippie Redd cries out “Oh my God” is immediately recognizable. I like this 
	  song enough to know all the words, and I think it will be a classic for years to come.

      My only complaint is that the background beat only momentarily changes, which can get monotonous, 
      but serves remixes very well. Freshman year me would have rated this song a 9 or 10, but Junior 
      year me has to rate this a 7 or 8. Things just aren’t the same, but this song still is one of my favorites.

      <h3>The Lo-Fis- 6/10</h3><p>by Steve Lacy</p>
      <p class="fontsize container">
      Before I even get into this review, this album is a project that Steve Lacy created in HIGH SCHOOL. Nearly 4 years later, 
      it's like a time capsule showing where Lacy started and it makes where he is now even more impressive.
       Steve Lacy is one of the most revolutionary artists in the Indie genre and I think that 
      he is a symbol of the independent style of music. He recorded his most popular song, “Dark Red” on garage band with 
      no record label supporting him. When I first got into Indie music, I listened to every Steve Lacy 
      song he ever released starting with “C U Girl”. While I have a different taste now, I still enjoy some 
      of Lacy’s songs and am excited to listen to his new album that dropped December 4th, 2020.

      I thoroughly enjoyed this album. Lo-Fi, meaning lo fidelity, is a much more relaxed music and the 
      fact that Lacy titled his album “The Lo-Fis” immediately piqued my interest. I like the fact that the 
      album feels slightly unfinished because it matches the messy collage of pictures that make up the cover.
       There are certainly diamonds in the rough. Lacy is best when he is paired with another artist and he 
       produces the beats. On the other hand, “Infrunami” highlights his vocals and harmonies. “4real” has a 
       contagious fast paced snare and kick which are impossible to resist bouncing your foot to. “I Think 
       I Should” has only acoustic music and when Lacy adds in his vocals and harmonies it makes it quite 
       enjoyable. Somehow, he finds rhythm in the chaos, and I’m here for it.

      While some songs are over a minute, others are shorter than 40 seconds. This makes it difficult to add 
      to a playlist because it can be awkward when shuffling. Otherwise, I think that “Uuuu” ends too soon and 
      almost cuts the song off. “Bars.16” has the lo-fi relaxed beat that I like with melodic background vocals, 
      but it has essentially no main vocals. It is important to note that normalcy isn’t Lacy’s sound so this is 
      on par with his work, but I would like it better with some features or more vocals.

      <h3>Coloring Book- 7/10</h3><p>by Chance the Rapper</p>
      <p class="fontsize container">
      This album, despite being 4 years ago, still remains high up on my list of Rap albums. Originally, My
       friend recommended that I listen to “No Problems” and it changed my perception of rap music. Chance 
       balances actual rapping skills and melodic beats which fits my sweet spot for music. Unfortunately, 
       I have been a fan of Chance since this album, and he has disappointed time and time again. He got
        married to his wife and had two daughters which drastically shifted his music from rap to semi-gospel
         rap. Kanye did something similar but there’s no question that “Ye”, “The Life of Pablo”, and 
         “The College Dropout” are far better than “Jesus is King”. In my eyes, Chance fell off. He had real 
         talent and if he released more music along the lines of “ Coloring Book” he would be much more 
         respected in the rap industry.

      I really like every song on this album. “Summer Friends” is a classic, “Same Drugs” is a nostalgic tear 
      jerker, “All Night” is upbeat and energizing. The album is solid all around, and I will always remember
       sitting in my family room playing Destiny 1 listening to it for the first time. I think that out of
        all of his albums, this showed tremendous growth and shows what Chance could have been if he chose
         a different route in his life. It is important to highlight how much charity work he does and how he
          strives to be a good person in the public eye, but I will mourn the loss of an un-made album of 
          the same caliber of  “Coloring Book”.

      I have no single complaint about it, but it is missing a wow factor that other albums have. I can’t
       listen to this album over and over and over again. It just bores me, and I would probably have given 
       this a higher rating years ago when I thought Chance would improve even more on his music. But life gets 
       in the way, and he chose the path that he wanted to which I can’t dislike him for. I think that a 
       combination of the massive failure that his most recent album “The Big Day” was and how I have seen 
       him interact with fans put me off to his music. I remember scrolling through twitter and reading as he gave 
       into an internet troll and honestly stepped over the line. I think that celebrities especially musicians 
       should use social media, but they shouldn’t interact in a negative way.

      Tik Tok once again has blessed my ears with indie music. I don’t know much about Dr. Dog, but the band has an extensive
       discography with 14 albums. The indie style in my opinion is old fashioned because they are, yet I like the heavy 
       reliance on drums and synthesized vocals. I can’t explain why their music makes me feel comforted, but I can see their
      music being something that I show my own kids long in the future. I am forever grateful for the music Tik Tok has provided me.

        drums in combination with the long drawing of  the first verse “starting to fly” at 35 seconds .The way that the 
        song picks up the tempo and then returns to the music of the original verse makes the song feel well rounded. I 
        like how the music fits with the ebb and flow of the vocals. Overall I really enjoy this song not to mention the 
        <em>guitar solo</em>. Initially I didn’t like the intro, but with time I began to really enjoy it. Dr. Dog does a
         great job diversifying each song and I am looking forward to listening to their extensive collection of released music.

      <p class="fontsize container">I would say that my only dislike is the fast change of the music. I love the first
       verse and would have liked to have three verses not two. The song pitches up really fast in the chorus which isn’t 
       necessarily bad, but I won’t be able to sing it in my car alone which is a shame.

      <h3>Laugh Now Cry Later- 6/10</h3><p>by Drake ft. Lil Durk</p>
      <p class="fontsize container">
      Drake is ranked among my top 5 rappers for personal enjoyment and the duration of time that I’ve been a fan of his. The 
      summer of 2017 was the first time that I started listening to rap and it was arguably one of the best years of rap in 
      the past decade. Since his album “More Life” Drake has blown up even more than previously imaginable. He has the
       ideal life for any rapper in my opinion: wealthy, talented, and in a position of influence. When Drake posts on 
       social media I find it to be calculated and influential on his audience (I say with bias as I myself am influenced).

      <p class="fontsize container">The first time I listened to this song I immediately noticed the synth horns in the 
      background. Similar to “Middle Child” by J Cole, I knew this would blow up because when an artist can tie other instruments
       from the brass family into rap it resonates with listeners. While it took a few listens, this song blew up with popularity.
        I think this was in large part because of the music video which featured two Maybach concept cars at the Nike world 
        headquarters with multiple professional athletes. I myself watched it over and over a good amount of times.

      <p class="fontsize container">I think that this song is very developed all around. I don’t think there is anything 
      wrong with the song but find the repeated trumpets to be a little monotonous even when mixed with 808’s in the chorus. 
      That is quite literally the only thing I don’t like because, although it makes the song catchy, it can also make it annoying. 
      I gave it the rating I did because of the annoyance factor.

      <h3>Astroworld- 10/10</h3><p>by Travis Scott</p>
      <p class="fontsize container">
      This album is my favorite album of any artist in any genre. Period end of story. I’m sure that anyone reading this 
      has some song or album that they remember exactly when and where they heard it first. For me, “Astroworld’ is that 
      album. I was 14 years old, a rising high school freshmen, at sleep away camp and I had gotten into rap music the summer 
      before. It was visiting day, and my friends who were in the older cabin told me that they were going to listen to the 
      newly released album. Maybe 10 people total went into cabin 19B (the cabin for the oldest boys) and we laid on empty 
      beds and listened to the album. I remember asking over and over again if there was a new song playing, but I came 
      to learn that Travis Scott has a unique talent to change up the beat of a song in a seamless way. This album lead 
      me to becoming a hardcore Travis fan for the entirety of my freshmen year and I even saw the concert at the Prudential 
      Center. I got an Astroworld hoodie, t-shirt, and tapestry so that should help paint the picture a little more. 
      The nostalgia factor of this album doesn’t even compare to the technical genius, production, and features in this 
      album. I love this album with my whole heart and don’t think that I will ever forget it.

      <p class="fontsize container">I do not have a single favorite song from this album because it changes every day.
       I personally think that “Stargazing” sets the tone of the rest of the album perfectly and even though it was extremely 
       popular, it never got overplayed. “Sicko Mode” is a great song with one of the best Drake features of all time and it 
       got overplayed fast, yet I still enjoy the song and it hypes me up for whatever occasion. “R.I.P. Screw” is one of my 
       favorite songs because of the chorus and infectious lyrics. I could continue and tell you how great “No Bystanders”, 
       “Wake Up”, and “Stop Trying to be God” are but I’m sure you get the point. “Butterfly Effect” is a classic from the 
       summer before the album was released but that doesn’t take away from it at all. Even “Coffee Bean” grew on me over time 
       as it is a more lyrical song than the rest of the album. I could say multiple things about each song, but I think it is 
       in your best interest to listen to it yourself. This song defined my rap music taste and I am very thankful for it. 
       Seriously, at Thanksgiving I could say that I am thankful for “Astroworld”.

      <p class="fontsize container"> I have one critique for the album: “NC-17”. “NC-17” is the only song on the entire
       album of 17 songs that I don’t have in my playlist. I still know all the words, but I find there to be more empty audio 
       of music than lyrics which is unlike the other songs in the album. Despite my dislike for “NC-17”, I still would rate 
       this album a 10/10 because I can listen through this any day at any hour. It is my comfort album and I <b>STRONGLY</b> 
       urge you to listen to it at least once.

      <h3>Where'd All the Time Go?- 8/10</h3><p>by Dr.Dog</p>
      <p class="fontsize container">
      Tik Tok once again has blessed my ears with indie music. I don’t know much about Dr. Dog, but the band has an extensive
       discography with 14 albums. The indie style in my opinion is old fashioned because they are, yet I like the heavy 
       reliance on drums and synthesised vocals. I can’t explain why their music makes me feel comforted, but I can see their
      music being something that I show my own kids long in the future. I am forever grateful for the music Tik Tok has provided me.

      <p class="fontsize container">When the first verse starts on this song, I enter an elevated state of relief. Once
       the guitar is added to the intro music and the filtered vocals chime in I feel my chest tighten. The acoustic guitar and
        drums in combination with the long drawing of  the first verse “starting to fly” at 35 seconds .The way that the 
        song picks up the tempo and then returns to the music of the original verse makes the song feel well rounded. I 
        like how the music fits with the ebb and flow of the vocals. Overall I really enjoy this song not to mention the 
        <em>guitar solo</em>. Initially I didn’t like the intro, but with time I began to really enjoy it. Dr. Dog does a
         great job diversifying each song and I am looking forward to listening to their extensive collection of released music.

      <p class="fontsize container">I would say that my only dislike is the fast change of the music. I love the first
       verse and would have liked to have three verses not two. The song pitches up really fast in the chorus which isn’t 
       necessarily bad, but I won’t be able to sing it in my car alone which is a shame.

      <h3>Laugh Now Cry Later- 6/10</h3><p>by Drake ft. Lil Durk</p>
      <p class="fontsize container">
      Drake is ranked among my top 5 rappers for personal enjoyment and the duration of time that I’ve been a fan of his. The 
      summer of 2017 was the first time that I started listening to rap and it was arguably one of the best years of rap in 
      the past decade. Since his album “More Life” Drake has blown up even more than previously imaginable. He has the
       ideal life for any rapper in my opinion: wealthy, talented, and in a position of influence. When Drake posts on 
       social media I find it to be calculated and influential on his audience (I say with bias as I myself am influenced).

      <p class="fontsize container">The first time I listened to this song I immediately noticed the synth horns in the 
      background. Similar to “Middle Child” by J Cole, I knew this would blow up because when an artist can tie other instruments
       from the brass family into rap it resonates with listeners. While it took a few listens, this song blew up with popularity.
        I think this was in large part because of the music video which featured two Maybach concept cars at the Nike world 
        headquarters with multiple professional athletes. I myself watched it over and over a good amount of times. 
      </p>
      <center><h4>Dislikes:</h4></center>
      <p class="fontsize container">I think that this song is very developed all around. I don’t think there is anything 
      wrong with the song but find the repeated trumpets to be a little monotonous even when mixed with 808’s in the chorus. 
      That is quite literally the only thing I don’t like because, although it makes the song catchy, it can also make it annoying. 
      I gave it the rating I did because of the annoyance factor.

      <h3>Astroworld- 10/10</h3><p>by Travis Scott</p>
      <p class="fontsize container">
      This album is my favorite album of any artist in any genre. Period end of story. I’m sure that anyone reading this 
      has some song or album that they remember exactly when and where they heard it first. For me, “Astroworld’ is that 
      album. I was 14 years old, a rising high school freshmen, at sleep away camp and I had gotten into rap music the summer 
      before. It was visiting day, and my friends who were in the older cabin told me that they were going to listen to the 
      newly released album. Maybe 10 people total went into cabin 19B (the cabin for the oldest boys) and we laid on empty 
      beds and listened to the album. I remember asking over and over again if there was a new song playing, but I came 
      to learn that Travis Scott has a unique talent to change up the beat of a song in a seamless way. This album lead 
      me to becoming a hardcore Travis fan for the entirety of my freshmen year and I even saw the concert at the Prudential 
      Center. I got an Astroworld hoodie, t-shirt, and tapestry so that should help paint the picture a little more. 
      The nostalgia factor of this album doesn’t even compare to the technical genius, production, and features in this 
      album. I love this album with my whole heart and don’t think that I will ever forget it.

      <p class="fontsize container">I do not have a single favorite song from this album because it changes every day.
       I personally think that “Stargazing” sets the tone of the rest of the album perfectly and even though it was extremely 
       popular, it never got overplayed. “Sicko Mode” is a great song with one of the best Drake features of all time and it 
       got overplayed fast, yet I still enjoy the song and it hypes me up for whatever occasion. “R.I.P. Screw” is one of my 
       favorite songs because of the chorus and infectious lyrics. I could continue and tell you how great “No Bystanders”, 
       “Wake Up”, and “Stop Trying to be God” are but I’m sure you get the point. “Butterfly Effect” is a classic from the 
       summer before the album was released but that doesn’t take away from it at all. Even “Coffee Bean” grew on me over time 
       as it is a more lyrical song than the rest of the album. I could say multiple things about each song, but I think it is 
       in your best interest to listen to it yourself. This song defined my rap music taste and I am very thankful for it. 
       Seriously, at Thanksgiving I could say that I am thankful for “Astroworld”.

      <p class="fontsize container"> I have one critique for the album: “NC-17”. “NC-17” is the only song on the entire
       album of 17 songs that I don’t have in my playlist. I still know all the words, but I find there to be more empty audio 
       of music than lyrics which is unlike the other songs in the album. Despite my dislike for “NC-17”, I still would rate 
       this album a 10/10 because I can listen through this any day at any hour. It is my comfort album and I <b>STRONGLY</b> 
       urge you to listen to it at least once.

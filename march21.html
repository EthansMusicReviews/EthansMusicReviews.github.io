				This week’s first review is inspired by the topic of Mac Miller in last

					  Mac passed away so young. I know he has a lot of unreleased music, but 
					  I can respect and appreciate that his family has not released anything 
					  like xxxtentacion. X’s mom released his music and it went downhill fast. 
					  This album discusses how Mac is swimming in pain, trying to keep a float 
					  on top of his life and emotions which is clear through vocals in his songs.

							<p class="fontsize"> 
							I need to address my favorite part of “What’s the Use?”: Thundercat’s 
						  phenomenal base performance. This song was performed at Mac’s Tiny Desk 
						  Concert on youtube and it made me a fan. I like how relaxed Mac’s music 
						  is. The lyrics are also very profound as they are in his music and you 
						  can get a good idea of the struggles he was facing before his death. 
						  “Wings” is my favorite song on the album and I think it has the most 
						  meaningful lyrics and melodic beat. There are other songs like “Ladders” 
						  which is much more upbeat and optimistic. The album has a great range 
						  that reflects Mac’s life and I thoroughly enjoy it time and time again. 
							</p> 
					
				<h4 style="color:gray">Dislikes:</h4> 
							<p class="fontsize"> 
							“Conversation Pt. 1” is not my favorite which seems to be a common 
						  theme as it has the least number of streams out of all the songs on 
						  the album. In a similar way that “NC-17” is not enough to make 
						  Astroworld a 9/10, this song is not enough to take away a point from 
						  this album. I think it is a beautiful album deserving to be among the 
						  ranks of “This Old Dog” and “Astroworld” at the top of my rankings.

							“What You Need” is a very good vibe that matches my music taste. You 
						  can tell that this is older because of the lack of the synth and drums 
						  that you can typically hear in his new music. The first half of “House 
						  of Balloons / Glass Table Girls” has a really cool beat that I enjoyed. 
						  “The Morning” is one of the two songs that I knew from before listening 
						  to this, but it is by far my favorite song.  “Wicked Games” is also a 
						  classic Weeknd song that everyone should listen to. “The Party & The 
						  After Party” is a good song that samples the next song I will recommend. 
						  The other songs on this album are also very high quality and it builds 
						  my respect for The Weeknd.

				<h4 style="color:gray">Dislikes:</h4> 
							<p class="fontsize"> 
							My main complaint about this song is the length of the songs. Every

						  I don’t not like this album, but it’s not my favorite. I think that 
						  Drake’s “So Far Gone” is a better 10 year release than this. I just 
						  don’t find it that special which is why it is going to receive  a 6/10.

				Beach House was brought to my attention by, you guessed it, Tik Tok. I am 
					  by no means disappointed because they have such an extensive volume of 
					  music released. Their fans try to gatekeep their music and hide it from 
					  social media, but I haven’t found any of their songs to be overplayed yet.

							This song has a great beat that has a great chorus. The melodic keys 
						  accented in the chorus literally make you feel like you are floating 
						  through space. I find this song to be perfect for staring at the 
						  ceiling wondering, Why? The drums are a meager kick and they don’t 
						  dominate the song. It’s the synth that makes this special.

							<p class="fontsize"> 
							Everyone could see it coming, but it is a really long song. I don’t 
						  get bored with the song, but listening to it more than twice in a row 
						  is dangerous. I really do like this song and it symbolizes a sound of 
						  indie music that I look for which is why I gave it such a high score. 
						  I honestly can’t wait to listen to this during the summer walking 
						  through empty streets. Give it a listen!

							This beat is the precise algorithm for my happiness. The variation 
							  of the beat makes the 2:46 not enough. Freddie’s voice grounds the 
							  song really well and ScHoolboy Q does the same. The chorus is so 
							  flowy and it makes this art. I can’t say anything more, just 
							  listen, it's clearly a great song.

							I have nothing. It is amazing. All 166 seconds of this song are 
							  perfect. I just think that time will tell if this is a 10/10 or not.

							I like the use of the piano synth in this song a lot. The initial intro 
						  is nice with some instrument that I don’t know. The vocals and the low 
						  pitched piano works really well especially around 1:50. It's a pretty 
						  basic song, but I enjoy it and it's only about 3 minutes which is short 
						  enough for the relatively straightforward song. Without drums the short 
						  length and soothing piano round the song out well. 
							</p> 
					
				<h4 style="color:gray">Dislikes:</h4> 
							<p class="fontsize"> 
							Yeah, I do like this song but it is kind of boring. I think that it’s a 
						  great song to listen to while you stare at the ceiling or just to relax, 
						  but there are other more diverse songs that I prefer. Musically I like 
						  how the song fits together, but the lack of drums make it hard for me 
						  to stay interested.

							The actual instruments used in this song are absolutely the best part 
						  of the song. I like how it feels almost medieval, and the piano and 
						  other strings in combination with the harp are really nice together. 
						  The climax of the song builds a pressure in my chest around 1:44 and 
						  2:22. I actually prefer the single mix of “Old Friends” and “Bookends” 
						  because it allows the song to wind down more.  
							</p> 
					
				<h4 style="color:gray">Dislikes:</h4> 
							<p class="fontsize"> 
							I don’t like the build up to the final drop of the song around 2:00 
						  because the strings almost squeal, but it is amazing when it does drop. 
						  I think that I really like the harp in the song but I like the climax 
						  and drop even more. My waiting takes away from the song but it is still 
						  a magnificent song.

							<p class="fontsize"> 
							I don’t have many complaints about this song with the exception of

							  really enjoy this song, although it doesn’t excite me as much as

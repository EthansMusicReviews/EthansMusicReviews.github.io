				  The beat in this song is absolutely insane. The combination of a quick 
				  beat and fast delivered vocals is art. I usually don’t like much new 
				  rap but I can definitely enjoy this song. The intro creates tension 
				  and YBN Nahmir comes in with some <b>HEAT</b>. Not to mention the 21 
				  verse which sounds just like old 21. I feel like he has been different 
				  since he was uncovered for being British. I still find that hilarious 
				  by the way.  The song is also relatively short which I really like.

				  I don’t have problems, but I do have a concern that the song is going

				  me which is why I gave it an 8/10.

				  This song has a great beat that has a great chorus. The melodic keys 
				  accented in the chorus literally make you feel like you are floating 
				  through space. I find this song to be perfect for staring at the 
				  ceiling wondering, Why? The drums are a meager kick and they don’t 
				  dominate the song. It’s the synth that makes this special.

				  Everyone could see it coming, but it is a really long song. I don’t 
				  get bored with the song, but listening to it more than twice in a row 
				  is dangerous. I really do like this song and it symbolizes a sound of 
				  indie music that I look for which is why I gave it such a high score. 
				  I honestly can’t wait to listen to this during the summer walking 
				  through empty streets. Give it a listen!

					  This beat is the precise algorithm for my happiness. The variation 
					  of the beat makes the 2:46 not enough. Freddie’s voice grounds the 
					  song really well and ScHoolboy Q does the same. The chorus is so 
					  flowy and it makes this art. I can’t say anything more, just 
					  listen, it's clearly a great song.

				  I like the use of the piano synth in this song a lot. The initial intro 
				  is nice with some instrument that I don’t know. The vocals and the low 
				  pitched piano works really well especially around 1:50. It's a pretty 
				  basic song, but I enjoy it and it's only about 3 minutes which is short 
				  enough for the relatively straightforward song. Without drums the short 
				  length and soothing piano round the song out well.

				  Yeah, I do like this song but it is kind of boring. I think that it’s a 
				  great song to listen to while you stare at the ceiling or just to relax, 
				  but there are other more diverse songs that I prefer. Musically I like 
				  how the song fits together, but the lack of drums make it hard for me 
				  to stay interested.

				  The actual instruments used in this song are absolutely the best part 
				  of the song. I like how it feels almost medieval, and the piano and 
				  other strings in combination with the harp are really nice together. 
				  The climax of the song builds a pressure in my chest around 1:44 and 
				  2:22. I actually prefer the single mix of “Old Friends” and “Bookends” 
				  because it allows the song to wind down more.

				  I don’t like the build up to the final drop of the song around 2:00 
				  because the strings almost squeal, but it is amazing when it does drop. 
				  I think that I really like the harp in the song but I like the climax 
				  and drop even more. My waiting takes away from the song but it is still 
				  a magnificent song.

					  This beat is beyond catchy and I think Paak’s voice is tame for his
